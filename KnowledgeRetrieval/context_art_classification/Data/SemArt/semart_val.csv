07635-89d_stil.jpg	The attribution of this still-life to Caravaggio is doubtful.From a thematic point of view, large scale still-lifes in the Galleria Borghese are similar to outstanding early works by Caravaggio, but they lack the brilliance and the concentration on individual objects. This painting and another are usually attributed to Caravaggio. Because it is rather unconvincing to attribute such work to Caravaggio, some scholars distinguish this Caravaggesque painter of still-lifes from the master by naming him - after a splendid example of the genre - the Painter of the Still-Life in the Wadsworth Athenaeum, Hartford.

17237-5portra5.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 541, JH 1893.Working from the large-format portrait drawing that Gauguin left in Arles at the end of December 1888, van Gogh returned to the subject of the Arlésienne in January 1890, simultaneously drawing on his reinterpretation of Madame Ginoux with Books of 1888 (F 488). As yet untitled in the painting of that year, the books accompanying Madame Ginoux in subsequent variant all bear the same two titles: Harriet Beecher-Stove's Uncle Tom's Cabin and Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol.Four of the five original variants of the portrait survived, they are in the Rijksmuseum Kröller-Müller, Otterlo, in the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna e Contemporanea, Rome, in the Museu de Arte, S&#227;o Paulo, and in a private collection	GOGH, Vincent van	L'Arlésienne (Madame Ginoux)	Oil on canvas, 65 x 49 cm	February 1890, Saint-Rémy	portrait	Dutch	1851-1900
35952-4amster1.jpg	Genre painting in Holland embraced all areas of life: scenes from daily life, domestic interiors, still-lifes, seascapes, landscapes, architectural views and urban scenes. The Dutch were proud of their nation and its many different faces, and genre paintings were in great demand amongst the middle and upper classes. Like many artists, Saenredam chose to specialize - in his case, in paintings of architecture ranging from urban views and famous buildings to church interiors	SAENREDAM, Pieter Jansz	The Old Town Hall in Amsterdam	Oil on panel, 65 x 85 cm	1657	landscape	Dutch	1601-1650
10998-307david.jpg	When David was released from the Luxembourg prison at the end of December 1794, he became ill and so requested permission from the Convention to visit his wife's sister and her husband, Emilie and Pierre Sériziat, at their country house in Saint Ouen, near Tournan-en-Brie, about 32 km (20 miles) east of Paris. This visit was cut short by the accusations of May 1795 and arrest, but he returned there, accompanied by a guard, to recuperate after his second and final release in August. He then painted the portraits of his hosts. Madame Sériziat is shown in an interior setting with her young son, having just returned from a walk. Her cheeks are ruddy and she carries a recently picked bunch of wild flowers which are painted in a lively but meticulous manner.These two portraits were testaments of friendship and, by showing them at the 1795 Salon, he could prove that he was still able to paint after his ordeals	DAVID, Jacques-Louis	Portrait of Emilie Sériziat and her Son	Oil on canvas, 131 x 96 cm	1795	portrait	French	1801-1850

37840-venusado.jpg	This typical Mannerist painting depicts Adonis taking leave of Venus. The two white turtledoves on the right and the small Cupid holding an arrow on the left symbolizes their love. In the right background a satyr hands a piece of fruit to a nymph, while on the right two satyrs and two nymphs return from the hunt. Depicting idealized figures, nude or otherwise, in contrasting poses was a predilection that Spranger shared with many artists working at Rudolph's court in Prague	SPRANGER, Bartholomaeus	Venus and Adonis	Oil on panel, 135 x 109 cm	c. 1587	mythological	Flemish	1551-1600
14473-404fried.jpg	A symbolic and heavy sadness lies over the Graveyard under Snow. We are now looking from inside the cemetery across the grave to the open gate, which is surrounded by a latticework of bare branches. The stormy sky is dead and empty. The open grave in the foreground has prompted much speculation.

05288-2lastjud.jpg	The left wing of the triptych represents the Paradise.Here, across the three inner panels, appear the First and Last Things, beginning with the Fall of Man on the left wing.The story recounted in the second and third chapters of Genesis has been placed in a lush garden; in the foreground we see the creation of Eve, followed by the temptation of the First Couple. In the middle distance they are driven from the garden by an angel. The expulsion of Adam and Eve from Eden is paralleled above by the expulsion from Heaven of the Rebel Angels, who are transformed into monsters as they descend to earth. Although the revolt of proud Lucifer and his followers is not mentioned in Genesis, it appears in Jewish legends and entered Christian doctrine at an early age. These were the angels who sinned and whose prince, envying Adam, caused him to sin in turn. It was further believed that Adam and Eve had been created by God in order that their offspring might fill the places left vacant by the fallen angels. In this panel, Bosch thus depicted the entrance of sin into the world and accounted for the necessity of the Last Judgment.The inclusion of the Fall of Adam and Eve in a representation of the Last Judgment is unusual; the other two panels of the Vienna triptych depart even more from traditional iconography	BOSCH, Hieronymus	Last Judgment Triptych (left wing)	Mixed technique on panel, 167 x 60 cm	1504-08	religious	Netherlandish	1451-1500
35579-24spinol.jpg	"Don Ambrogio Spinola Doria, marqués de los Balbases (1569-1630), was an Italian general, at the service of Spain. He is often called ""Ambrosio"", especially in Spanish-speaking countries. The most significant act of his career was the taking of Breda, depicted in the famous painting by Velázquez.This portrait of Spinola can be compared with his other portrait by Rubens, presently in Braunschweig"	RUBENS, Peter Paul	Portrait of Ambrogio Spinola	Oil on oak, 117 x 85 cm	1625-28	portrait	Flemish	1601-1650
18706-4sacrif.jpg	Girolamo Godi, organizer of a Vicenzan literary salon and friend of Pietro Bembo and Alvise Cornaro, engaged Gualtiero around 1550 to decorate the villa. In addition to the loggia, the decoration of four rooms in the right wing of the villa can be ascribed to Gualtiero: the Hall of the Gods or the Putto, the Hall of the Triumphs, the Hall of the Caesars, and the Hall of the Sacrifices. Gualtiero's sudden death in 1552 prevented him from completing the work which was taken over by Battista Zelotti and Battista del Moro, who created the frescoes in the other rooms.In the Hall of the Sacrifices allegorical figures ornament the walls. The figure with elongated limbs shows the influence of Parmigianino	GUALTIERO PADOVANO	View of the Hall of the Sacrifices	Fresco	1550-52	interior	Italian	1501-1550
12961-cardinal.jpg	Cardinal Guido Bentivoglio (1579-1644), an Italian cardinal, statesman and historian, commissioned this portrait of himself. As papal nuncio, he had work for peace between the Catholics and the Protestants in Flanders, and the Catholics and the French Protestants (the Huguenots) in France. Van Dyck, refining the robust style of his master, Rubens, specialized in long, sensitive fingers and the lush treatment of fabrics - note the sitter's moiré robe	DYCK, Sir Anthony van	Portrait of Cardinal Guido Bentivoglio	Oil on canvas, 195 x 147 cm	c. 1625	portrait	Flemish	1601-1650
20876-woman.jpg	This painting, depicting a woman pulling water from a well, a pile of vegetables at her feet, is an example of Kalf's Parisian period. The outstanding feature of the painting is the pile of vegetables at the woman's feet, a still-life within a larger genre scene. This corner of the work hints at the skill and precision that characterise the dedicated still-lifes, which Kalf painted later in his career	KALF, Willem	Woman Pulling Water from a Well	Oil on copper, 27 x 22 cm	c. 1645	genre	Dutch	1651-1700
32074-piacenza.jpg	The decoration was executed by Pordenone and Bernardino Gatti.Domes, which vault the crossing and altar of countless churches, lend themselves well to being transformed into paintings of the sky. The round shape above our heads seems to  open onto a higher world, so that God and the things of heaven become visually present at the church holiest spot.Astonishing dynamic effects in dome decorations were achieved by Pordenone. In the large ribbed dome of Santa Madonna di Campagna in Piacenza, in 1530-32, Pordenone began to fresco a complex theological program. God the Father floats in the cupola, mysteriously illuminated by invisible windows. Putti, animals, and illusionistic reliefs of Old Testament stories decorate the ribs. In between them heroic sibyls, prophets, and other Old Testament figures are seen against views of the heavens. In 1543 Bernardino Gatti added apostles on the pilasters of the drum below, stories from the life of Mary on the next level, and finally evangelists on the pendentives	PORDENONE	Decoration of the main dome	Fresco	1530-32	religious	Italian	1501-1550
42101-19studi2.jpg	The Studiolo is a tiny chamber in the Palazzo dei Priori (Palazzo Vecchio), accessible by a hidden spiral staircase. It was dedicated to the geological, mineralogical and alchemical interest of Francesco I de' Medici, son and successor of Cosimo I. Its walls are lined with two tiers of oil paintings on slate or panel that act as doors for cupboards containing Francesco's scientific books, specimens, and instruments. Two doors, not distinguished in any way from the cupboard doors, cover the only windows: Francesco preferred to work by candlelight.The intimate scale of the project allowed Vasari and his pupils to develop their imaginative abilities, technical skill, and jewel-like delicacy of colour. Eight sculptors made the bronze statuettes, and the paintings were by twenty-four artists. This precious chamber is the only sixteenth-century room in Europe to survive with its oil paintings intact	VASARI, Giorgio	View of the Studiolo	Oil on panel and slate	1570-75	interior	Italian	1551-1600

12539-07docto.jpg	At the same time as the Feast of the Rose Garlands, Dürer was working on the painting of Christ among the Doctors. The theme derives from the Gospel of St Luke (Luke 2, 41-52).On the bookmark at the bottom left of the panel, Dürer has recorded that this picture was `the work of five days', a pointed reference to his inscription on The Altarpiece of the Rose Garlands, the work of five months. Christ among the Doctors is not only a smaller panel, but the brushwork is much more spontaneous and the paint is applied with broad and fluid strokes. Despite Dürer's statement about five days, he based it on a number of careful studies, including one of Christ's gesticulating fingers. Although not present on the original painting, two early copies of the panel have the word `Romae' added to the inscription on the bookmark and this suggests that Dürer visited Rome late in 1506. It may also be significant that the original painting was in Rome's Galleria Barberini until its acquisition by Baron Heinrich von Thyssen-Bornemisza in 1935.The story recorded in the panel is of Christ's visit to Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem, where he debated with the learned Jewish doctors (or scribes). According to the Bible, this was the first occasion on which Christ taught. Dürer's daring composition does not use the conventional temple setting which he earlier used in the lower left panel of The Seven Sorrows of the Virgin. Instead he gives a close-up view of the faces of six doctors crowding round the young Jesus. The elderly doctors, caricatured faces which may well have been influenced by Leonardo da Vinci, argue with Christ by quoting from the Scriptures and gesticulating. Christ, a sober boy of 12, quietly gestures with his fingers to make a point. Dürer contrasts Christ's youthful hands with the gnarled fingers of the ugly old man with the white cap and a gap-toothed grin	DÜRER, Albrecht	Christ Among the Doctors	Oil on panel, 65 x 80 cm	1506	religious	German	1501-1550
40049-cabare15.jpg	Maxime Dethomas (1868-1928), painter and graphic artist, was a friend of Lautrec's and one of his favoured companions on brother-crawls.

15246-reading.jpg	Gérard specialized in domestic genre scenes, often depicting an idealized vision of the lives of bourgeois and upper class women. Usually depicted in intimate settings, her subjects enjoy lives of leisure with their families or engage in elegant pastimes.

17950-windmill.jpg	"The tonal style in Dutch landscape painting of the 1630s continued well into the 1640s, while still developing, especially in the hands of Jan van Goyen. The direction in which van Goyen took landscape reveals a considered logic; as tonal painting was a realistic attempt to capture an atmosphere, its consequence was, in the end, to paint the sky over the flat, low land. Thus, in his ""Windmill by a River"", the real subject is the moving skies.Everything is subordinated to the high sky, a sky that seems to take on the colour of the vast land stretching to a low, distant horizon: a brownish-green with tinges of blue. Only the sky contains more grey - the clouds - and is more transparent in its pictorial treatment. Dunes in the foreground, caught in a splash of sunlight, introduce the distance - suggesting a high viewpoint that gives the view naturalness. The windmill, painted in the greyish-brown colour of the sky, is a discreet spatial reference point"	GOYEN, Jan van	Windmill by a River	Oil on panel, 29,4 x 36,3 cm	1642	landscape	Dutch	1601-1650

41099-021pieta.jpg	The Man of Sorrows in the arms of God the Father with the Holy Ghost between them both is a kind of Seat of Mercy or more exactly a Trinity Piet&#224;. The type is met with frequently in French and Burgundian court painting from the end of the fourteenth century onwards. One of the best known and earliest preserved examples is the tondo by Jean Malouel in the Louvre. Both in the common Man of Sorrows type and in the Trinity Piet&#224;, angels are often supporting Christ's body on both sides or carrying instruments of the Passion. The small Cologne work is part of this tradition. The Man of Sorrows is flanked by four angels, with two of them holding the Flagellation column, the scourge, the stick with the sponge and the lance. This type clearly forms the basis of the Man of Sorrows borne by an angel by Master Francke which in turn led to the Virgin showing Man of Sorrows by Memling (Melbourne). The reverse features a Holy Face of Christ.The panel is attributed to the Master of Sankt Laurenz (St Lawrence), the pupil of the Cologne Master of St Veronica. It is also assumed that this small panel was the left wing of a diptych having, on the right, a Mater Dolorosa	UNKNOWN MASTER, German	Trinity Piet?

02961-johnbapt.jpg	Baglione, a colleague and rival of Caravaggio, explored the subject of St John the Baptist in the Wilderness as early as 1600 and he continued to paint images of St John the Baptist throughout his long and productive career.The probable model for the present version could be Caravaggio's St John the Baptist in Kansas City	BAGLIONE, Giovanni	St John the Baptist in the Wilderness	Oil on canvas, 194 x 151 cm	1610	religious	Italian	1601-1650

36867-pentapt3.jpg	This panel belonged to a now dismembered pentaptych (five-paneled altarpiece). In its original configuration, St Benedict was the left, St Silvester Gozzolini the right and the Madonna and Child the centre panels (all in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York). The centre panel was flanked by panels depicting St John the Baptist (Perkins Collection, Sacro Convento di San Francesco, Assisi), and St John the Evangelist (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York).When intact, the altarpiece would have resembled Duccio's polyptych in the Pinacoteca Nazionale, Siena (the so-called polyptych 47). The pairing of Sts John the Baptist and John the Evangelist - the forerunner of Christ and the beloved disciple - to either side of the Madonna and Child is not uncommon and may relate either to the dedication of the chapel or to the name of the patron. On the other hand, the presence of Sts Benedict (c. 480&#150;543) and Silvester Gozzolini (1177&#150;1267) virtually assures that the altarpiece was painted for a monastery of the Silvestrine order, which was founded by Silvester in 1231 and followed the rule of St Benedict	SEGNA DI BUONAVENTURE	St Silvester Gozzolini	Tempera on wood, gold ground, 125 x 53 cm	1320s	religious	Italian	1301-1350
08837-isaac.jpg	Cigoli's picture depicts one of the most dramatic moments in the Old Testament (Genesis 22: 1-14), where the Lord tests Abraham's faith by asking him to sacrifice his only son Isaac. Just as Abraham is about to slit Isaac's throat an angel miraculously appears and points to a ram, tangled in a thicket, that can be sacrificed instead. Cigoli shows the moment at which the angel intervenes, pulling back Abraham's arm as he points to the ram. According to Cigoli's nephew, Giovanni Battista Cardi, the picture was painted while his uncle was working for Cardinal Pompeo Arrigoni in Frascati just outside Rome. Cigoli, a Florentine, is documented in Rome between 1606-07, a date which accords well with the style of The Sacrifice of Isaac. There are several preparatory studies for the painting, one of which is on the verso of a drawing for Massimo Massimi's Ecce Homo of 1607, making it safe to assume that Cigoli was working on both pictures at the same time.Although The Sacrifice of Isaac was painted in Rome, the composition clearly recalls the Florentine tradition of Lorenzo Ghiberti and Andrea del Sarto. Isaac's sensuous nude body, however, reflects the artist's first-hand experience of classical sculpture. Despite the inherent suspense of the narrative, the picture itself lacks dramatic tension. Abraham's massive red tunic serves as a foil for Isaac's unblemished adolescent body, shifting the emphasis to the work's more lascivious characteristics. When the picture was criticised for its sexually evocative content by a visitor to Arrigoni's villa, the cardinal made an eloquent defence of the artist and the painting. The emotions evoked, he said, were the result of Cigoli's excellence as a painter; any stimulation was the fault of the viewer	CIGOLI	The Sacrifice of Isaac	Oil on canvas, 175,5 x 132,2 cm	c. 1607	religious	Italian	1551-1600

18383-1710grec.jpg	The identity of the sitter was only established in 1988, despite the fact that the portrait must record a prominent figure. He was identified with Francisco de Pisa (c. 1537-1616), Professor of Holy Scripture at Toledo University, the author of a major history of Toledo and a prominent figure in ecclesiastical affairs in the city. The identification rests on the striking resemblance between his features and those of a documented miniature of Francisco de Pisa in a private collection, that was, at one time, ascribed to El Greco himself.The open book displayed on the table is identified by lettering on its pages as BOSIUS CANONICI, presumably an edition or commentary on the corpus of canon law. The author of the text is probably Francesco Bossi or Bosio (1500/10-1584), who specialized in law. In Rome Bossi was closely associated with Carlo Borromeo, one of the key figures of the Catholic reform	GRECO, El	A Prelate	Oil on canvas, 107 x 90 cm	1600s	portrait	Spanish	1551-1600

In this dismounted equestrian portrait, Reynolds presents Colonel Coussmaker in a pose of casual but studied negligence, the line of his body repeated in the curving neck of the horse. The summer before Reynolds painted the portrait, he traveled to Holland and Flanders and profited by his observation of Rubens's works, especially in the creation of a free and painterly surface treatment	REYNOLDS, Sir Joshua	Colonel George K.

11679-6west.jpg	This fresco is located in the 5th bay on the west wall of the Pellegrinaio in the Spedale di Santa Maria della Scala. The Pellegrinaio, situated on the ground floor of the hospital, is a fourteenth-century room which took the form of a long vaulted hall.In the four scenes on the west wall, painted by Domenico di Bartolo, we find large numbers of figures gathered in a stagelike foreground and engaged in the various good works assigned to the hospital by statute in 1305. The settings for these depictions of everyday work of the hospital may reproduce actual spaces within the complex. For all their realism, the scenes are highly idealised.In the Caring for the Sick Domenico combines specific portraiture with a sensitive treatment of the nude figure.

20406-virgin_c.jpg	This painting was discovered in 1989 and attributed to Isenbrant. It was carefully copied, albeit in a different style, from Memling's Berlin Virgin Enthroned. The figure has been copied from Memling's work by means of a punch-cardboard and the colours also correspond, which shows that the work was then still accessible in Bruges. Isenbrant carried out some adaptations in Renaissance style, turning the original open portico into a semi-circular niche with medallions, baluster columns and a solid stone throne. Moreover, the book of hours has been given sixteenth-century floral borders in the Ghent-Bruges style and the flat top of the panel changed into an ogive shape.It is a remarkable example of the way in which Memling's compositions served as models until the sixteenth century	ISENBRANT, Adriaen	Virgin and Child Enthroned	Oil on oak panel, 77,5 x 56,5 cm	1510s	religious	Flemish	1501-1550

14347-descent.jpg	Ambrosius Francken was a member of the second generation of the family of painters in Antwerp. He was a Mannerist, and like other painters in the Low Countries in the last third of the 16th century, he became eclectic, a trend which itinerant Netherlandish artists of international culture helped to establish. His art was somewhat artificial, and his agitated style never achieved true pathos.This panel was painted 25 years before Rubens' Descent from the Cross, also in the Antwerp Cathedral.

43921-penn.jpg	The genre in which English painters were least happy in the second half of the 18th century was history painting; the efforts of Reynolds in this direction are strangely petrified for so living a painter. Yet it was through history painting that Neo-Classicism invaded the art in England. A Scot, Gavin Hamilton (1738-1820) and an American, Benjamin West, who enjoyed a prodigious success, were in advance of the French painter Jacques-Louis David in the conception of a painting as a scene from Classical history, based upon thorough archeological research.West was most successful when least pretentious; his illustrations of English historical events are simply illustrations, simply composed, uneffectedly direct. Neo-classicism had trained West to give value to the facts of the scene depicted, removing anything merely decorative or liable to spoil the sense of witnessing an actual event	WEST, Benjamin	The Treaty of Penn with the Indians	Oil on canvas, 190 x 274 cm	1771-72	historical	American	1751-1800

Pieter Brueghel the Younger and his busy studio produced numerous (over forty) copies and variations of the composition. The earliest known dated version by Brueghel the Younger is the painting dated 1601, the latest is dated 1626.

They were intended for private devotion.This painting, executed on an arched panel, is an extraordinarily refined Imago Pietatis: the dead Christ appears to rise from a sarcophagus attended by the Virgin and St John the Evangelist. Christ's body is wrapped in a shroud that leaves his torso exposed; his mother holds his head with her left arm, as the Evangelist supports Christ at the waist.

15510-6resurr.jpg	"The official prestige value of the upper picture on the main chapel wall (the Confirmation of the Rule) is clear. In contrast, the fresco beneath it, directly above the altarpiece, is devoted to the Sassetti family's private history. In 1478, the year of the Pazzi plot, their son Teodoro died; but a few months later Nera Corsi Sassetti gave birth to a second son. As they felt him to be a gift from God, they made yet another change in the plans for the altar wall in their mortuary chapel. Ghirlandaio had to abandon his design for a scene showing the appearance of Saint Francis in Arles, for which preliminary drawings still exist, and paint the Resurrection of the Boy. This was how the Sassetti intended to express their gratitude for their new-bon son Teodoro II.The events in the Resurrection of the Boy are taking place just outside the church of Santissima Trinita at the Ponte Santissima Trinita. ""... In it he represented the Ponte Santissima Trinita (the old one, by Taddeo Gaddi; the present one was built by Ammannati almost a hundred years later) with the palace of the Spini, the first scene showing the appearance of St Francis in the air to raise a child of that family... and other figures who are marvelling and rejoicing at the miracle, affording no little pleasure to the rest of us. Among them are portraits of Agnolo Acciaioli, Palla Strozzi..."" (Vasari).While playing, a boy falls out of the windows of the Palazzo Spini. A red ball falling to the street below him. Some passers-by see the falling child, rush up in help, but it is too late: the child is dead. The boy who met with the fatal accident is already lying on a bier surrounded by mourners. Then, however, two Franciscans succeed in interceding with Saint Francis on their behalf, and the child is brought back to life. The artist moved this miracle from Rome where it actually took place, to Florence - just outside the church in which the picture is painted  in order to be able to incorporate many of the portraits requested by the donor in the groups of onlookers"	GHIRLANDAIO, Domenico	Resurrection of the Boy	Fresco	1483-85	religious	Italian	1451-1500

The demonic element, that has power over the earth, is depicted like a dream. Goya is basically using a Baroque device, allegory.

29948-port_fam.jpg	The grotesque peasants carousing, brawling, or engaged in swinish gluttony in disorderly hovels are characteristic of Ostade's boisterous work of his early phase. In the 1640s his interiors gain in spaciousness and atmosphere. By the middle of the century Ostade had changed to a more idyllic style. His figures became calmer and more respectable. There is a new emphasis on local colour and an orderly arrangement. The reason for the shift in Ostade's mood has not been established. Perhaps it is related to a change in his clientele, to his own conception of himself, and his ideas about his task as an artist	OSTADE, Adriaen Jansz. van	Portrait of a Family	Oil on wood, 70 x 88 cm	1654	portrait	Dutch	1651-1700

41290-06martin.jpg	The panel, painted on both sides, was part of the moving wing of a winged altarpiece. The panel represents the best-known episode from the legend of St. Martin. The young knight at the town-gate of Amiens cuts his cloak in two and gives half of it to a beggar. In the interior represented on the left side of the picture another episode from the legend can be seen. Christ appears at night to Martin, who suddenly realizes that it was the Saviour himself who put him to the test in the guise of a beggar. He is then baptized.The building on the left, decorated with statues mounted on brackets, and the room into which we can look, show the distant influence of Netherlandish art. This building, a fantastic edifice of many storeys, is an imaginative feat on the part of the painter. Although it seems the painter had some difficulty in representing the figure on horseback, his skill is amply demonstrated in the symmetrical composition, the distressed expression of the faces, the careful treatment of such details as the hair and the beard, and also the freshness of the colours	UNKNOWN MASTER, Hungarian	Saint Martin and the Beggar	Tempera on wood, 88 x 91 cm	c. 1490	religious	Hungarian	1451-1500

11363-1delaroc.jpg	Delaroche's early work consists mainly of subjects from the Old Testament, while later he chose subjects from French and English history. He was one of the most popular painters of his time, his paintings satisfied the need for education through art and the demand for sensibility. Both his carefully researched interiors and costumes and the theatrical content made his paintings so popular. In The Death of Elizabeth I, Queen of England the cultivation of material actually distracts attention from the real subject. But this was in keeping with contemporary taste for decorative history painting, which had gone to extremes in its meticulous attention to detail in the objects, furniture, and costumes.The painting was exhibited at the Salon of 1827/28	DELAROCHE, Paul	The Death of Elizabeth I, Queen of England	Oil on canvas, 422 x 343 cm	1828	historical	French	1801-1850

This detail and also the triptych on the altar which recalls the one painted by Bastiani in his canvas depicting the ""Donation of the Relic"", suggests that Gentile Bellini wished here to set the scene in the interior of the church of St John the Evangelist. Echoing his father Jacopo's interest in Renaissance ""umbratile"", Gentile Bellini concentrates on the detailed rendering of the complex play of architectural surfaces within which human figures play their part"	BELLINI, Gentile	The Healing of Pietro dei Ludovici	Tempera on canvas, 369 x 259 cm	c. 1501	religious	Italian	1451-1500
06590-5sense1.jpg	This piece, a characteristic product of the Rubens workshop, is one of the paintings in the series depicting the five senses. The allegorical content of these works was always obvious, and the pieces of the series did not become separated. The still-life details enumerating many traditional symbols were painted by Jan Brueghel.The amazing increase in the commercial and agricultural product range caused a complete restructuring of people's perception - a change which can be seen very clearly in the numerous paintings and series of paintings on the subject of the Five Senses. Jan Brueghel the Elder's famous variations on this motif - now in the Prado, Madrid - show a number of settings, each of which is associated with the five senses. The dramatic 'unity of character' has been divided into components of the senses, thus reflecting an increasing compartmentalization of the world into functional spheres - a world which is defined in terms of luxury goods.In Jan Brueghel's paintings, the part of purely passive reception or physical consumption is played by an allegorical female figure. Interestingly, by depicting her naked or semi-naked breasts and sometimes her entire body, the painter emphasizes an element of eroticism. In this way the consumption of luxury goods and an emotional state of ecstasy are recognized as a syndrome.In the still-life of Hearing we can examine nearly all the instruments of the period. Near the Flemish harpsichord we can see a drum, a trumpet, a trombone, a cornetto, a lysard, several flutes, various sizes of violas and gambas, a lute, and a shawm. On a table to the right are a small horn, a trumpet, a bell and a reed pipe. The title of the musical score reveals that it is a six-part madrigal dedicated to Prince Pietro Philippi Albert and to Princess Isabella. The rifle, leaned against the chair, is rendered as a sound-producing implement, along with the other musical instruments used during a hunt; it does not unequivocally refer to Mars, as it has been proposed. In this painting the clock is not the symbol of transitoriness, rather it is a musical clock, several versions of which are visible in the right background. The talking and singing birds were also included on account of their voices. In the hall opening from the left rear, members of a musical group are entertaining themselves. The pictures on the wall of the room also refer to music: they depict the concert of the gods and Orpheus taming the wild animals with his music. The triptych showing the Annunciation and the announcement to the shepherds depicted on the inside cover of the harpsichord are also episodes which can be associated with sound.The nude female figure is, according to some opinions, Euterpe, the Muse of music, while others see her as Venus. The goddess of love may indeed be looked for in a painting associated with the human senses. Such supposition is supported by the presence of a little cherub (Amor?) in four of the five pictures, although he is only depicted as a winged Amor in the allegories of Touch and Sight.As an animal famous for its keen hearing, the stag became the symbol for this sense. In his Iconologia, Ripa prescribes the inclusion of a stag at the side of a woman playing the lute	BRUEGHEL, Jan the Elder	The Sense of Hearing	Oil on panel, 65 x 107 cm	1618	mythological	Flemish	1551-1600
30412-steccata.jpg	In the 1530s Parmigianino frescoed the under-arch above the altar in Santa Maria della Steccata. He graced his painted coffer articulation with sculptural rosettes. A colourful variety of fruit garlands, animals, and grotesques, in red and gold, produces a magnificent effect. At the spring line of the arch, Parmigianino painted two sets of three beautiful, graceful women in various side views, suggesting the Three Graces. Their elegance is analogous to the perfected sweeping forms of the precious vessels they bear on their heads. Grisaille figures of Adam and Eve and Moses and Aaron frame the group of women	PARMIGIANINO	Decoration of the under-arch above the main altar	Fresco	1530s	other	Italian	1501-1550
10944-doria2.jpg	The left wing of the diptych depicts the Virgin and Child in the Church, while the right wing the donor Antonio Siciliano and St Anthony.The diptych was commissioned by Antonio Siciliano who served as chamberlain and secretary to Massimiliano Sforza, the Duke of Milan. In 1513 he was dispatched to Margaret of Austria in Mechelen on a diplomatic mission. It is assumed that Siciliano commissioned the painting from Gossart, who about 1513 worked at Margaret's court in Mechelen. However, the authorship of the diptych is debated, especially that of the donor (right) wing. Several alternative suggestions were proposed, the authorship being connected to the Antwerp Mannerists or to the artists contributing to the Grimani Breviary. Presently the right wing is attributed to Jan Gossart.The left panel is attributed to Gerard David. This attribution is supported by recent technical examination. More than any other Bruges painter, David inherited Jan van Eyck's legacy. The left panel of the diptych is an adaptation of van Eyck's Madonna in the Church. David made adjustments to the earlier model: he centred the Virgin in a wider view of the nave, added a third arch to the choir screen, and closed off the composition at the right with a series of columns matching those of the bays opposite	DAVID, Gerard	The Doria-Pamphili Diptych (left wing)	Oil on oak panel, 40 x 22 cm	1510-15	religious	Flemish	1501-1550
22256-c_couple.jpg	"Judith Leyster is one of the very few women to have been accepted as a member of the Haarlem Guild of Painters. Although a contemporary historian described her as a leading light in art (punning on her name Leyster, which means ""lodestar"") she remained unknown for a long time and her works were either believed lost, or were attributed to Frans Hals. She probably worked in his studio around 1630 and was also a friend of his family, for one year later she became godmother to Hals' daughter Maria.Like Hals at the same time, the young Leyster adopted the style of the Utrecht Caravaggisti, with their strong chiaroscuro modelling in the manner of Caravaggio. From the mid-1620, she concentrated more on vividly illuminated genre scenes, generally featuring half figures of merry musicians, gamblers and whores, strongly influenced by the painting of Terbrugghen and Honthorst.While the Utrecht school of painters still rounded the surfaces of their objects smoothly between light and shade, Hals and his school adopted a broad, vibrant and independent brushstroke. Leyster's work can be distinguished from that of Hals through her generally more discordant handling of colour, her sketchier treatment of hands, the wryly distorted smiles of her figures and her altogether flightier brushwork"	LEYSTER, Judith	Carousing Couple	Oil on canvas, 68 x 54 cm	1630	genre	Dutch	1601-1650

09970-decadenc.jpg	The peak in theatrical Romanticism came in the Salon of 1847, Couture, a pupil of Gros, exhibited this painting nearly eight meters long. It had been commissioned by the government for the Palais du Luxembourg. One can see the work as the sum of all that French painting had striven for between the Neoclassical period and Romanticism. Not only does the work cite painterly and compositional devices from old masters like Veronese, Tiepolo, Rubens and Poussin, but to Couture's contemporaries the artist also seemed to have succeeded in combining Antiquity and the present. It is all to be found united here:  the antique columned hall, sculpture competing with living figures, beautiful forms created with line  in the manner of Ingres, and Delaroche's delight in detail.A woman is the central figure, placed so that she will draw all eyes. She is stretched out in the middle of a large crowd of people who are abandoning themselves to all the vices that are supposed to have led to the downfall of Roma. The scene is framed by five larger-than-life-size sculptures representing men from Roman history, their gestures seeming to demand a return to virtue	COUTURE, Thomas	Romans of the Decadence	Oil on canvas, 466 x 773 cm	1847	historical	French	1801-1850

40893-04virgin.jpg	The anonymous artist who executed this panel is referred to as the Master of the Embroidered Foliage. This name  is based on his characteristic foregrounds, carpeted with flowers and decorative leaves. He appears to have been active in Brussels and the South Netherlands, and was clearly influenced by such Flemish masters as Rogier van der Weyden and Hugo van der Goes.This painting is one of several autograph variant versions. A version having a similar throne is in the National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh.

The event depicted here took place during the latter stages of the Twelve Years Truce with the Spanish, when the nascent Dutch Republic was riven with internal political and religious strife.The concept and most of the execution of this painting are entirely that of Saenredam, the staffage figures and horses are by Pieter Post	SAENREDAM, Pieter Jansz	The Town Hall at Haarlem with the Entry of Prince Maurits to Replace the Governers in 1618	Oil on oak panel, 40 x 50 cm	c. 1631	historical	Dutch	1601-1650
16952-4portina.jpg	Soberly painted in monochrome, the panels are entirely occupied by the Archangel Gabriel and the Virgin of the Annunciation.

04592-venus_cu.jpg	Employing loose brushwork and warm effects of light and shadow, Bilivert was inspired by sixteenth century Venetian painting, Veronese's influence was evident. The artist was further influenced by his pupil, Francesco Furini, famous for his soft sfumato effects and the ambiguous sensuality of his many female nudes.

14512-lazar.jpg	This is the only other authentic work of Froment beside The Burning Bush. The central panel depicts The Raising of Lazarus, the other scenes on the side panels are Magdalen Anoints the Feet of Christ (right wing), Martha at the Feet of Christ (left wing), The Donors (outer face of right wing), The Madonna and Child (outer face of left wing).The tradition that the triptych was painted for Cosimo il Vecchio is rendered improbable by the fact that the donor is in clerical dress. The painting of the exterior faces, which bears the signature, is of a quality superior to that of the interior ones. It is assumed that the man looking out of the picture at the upper left corner of the central panel is a self-portrait	FROMENT, Nicolas	Triptych	Oil on wood, 175 x 134 cm (central), 175 x 66 cm (each side wing)	1461	religious	French	1451-1500

39841-0chieri1.jpg	The Villa Chiericati was built in the first half of the sixteenth century for Ludovico Chiericati, a nobleman from Vicenza. It underwent numerous restorations and reworkings over time, resulting in its current architectural form, an extended structure with a simple façade that is barely enlivened by a tympanum supported by four Ionic pilasters. A room on the north side, called Room of Landscapes, was decorated with six frescoes of landscape scenes, each incorporating two zodiac signs, by Lodewijk Toeput. During one of the updatings the frescoes were painted over, and it was not until the beginning of the nineteenth century, on the occasion of yet another restoration, that they were finally revealed.The landscapes contain explicit references to the sequence of the seasons and their related zodiac signs, the marking of time that rhythmically measures the work and the days of good guardianship of the land. These are extremely naturalistic paintings, at times enlivened by the presence of slender little figures rendered with a touch of vitality.On the wall shown in the present picture, the vivid figure of the page and his greyhound stand out flanked by a Landscape between Autumn and Winter and a Winter Landscape	TOEPUT, Lodewijk	View of a wall	Fresco	1580-85	other	Flemish	1551-1600

30993-christ_c.jpg	This canvas counts among the artists's  earliest works, realized before he had completely mastered the technique of preparing the support with red ocher and oil. Too much of the latter undermined the adhesiveness of the paint surface, which has flaked off and exposed the ocher ground, now turned a brownish colour. Based on a composition by Rubens, the work evinces stunning virtuosity in the handling of the three nude bodies, their torsioned attitudes the fruit of long and close anatomical study	PIAZZETTA, Giovanni Battista	Christ Crucified between the Two Thieves	Oil on canvas, 76 x 64 cm	c. 1710	religious	Italian	1701-1750
44024-0braque.jpg	"The armorial bearings on the back indicate that this portable triptych was the property of Jehan Braque and his wife Catherine de Brabant, of Tournai, who were married in about 1450-51. Jehan Braque died soon afterwards, in 1452; his young widow, who did not marry again till 1461, must have commissioned this triptych in his memory.The Braque Triptych ranks among Rogier van der Weyden's most celebrated works. It is a small-scale work of the kind that were set upon portable altars in the oratories of wealthy individuals. When closed, it shows the classical vanity theme, a skull and a cross. Open, it displays images of Christ in the centre, and to either side - the Virgin, St John the Evangelist, St John the Baptist and Mary Magdalene. They are represented against a landscape that is rendered down to the finest detail, with its rivers and mountains, grass and leaves so precisely drawn they could almost be counted and tiny figures visible in the distance in the streets of imaginary towns - a favourite motif of the Flemish masters.Pictures showing busts of Christ and the Virgin had existed earlier north of the Alps, but a sequence of several saints shown half length seems to derive from a type of altarpiece found in Italy from the 13th century onward. The innovation is to place them in front of a wide, coherent landscape relating to the figures themselves not realistically, but in context. It stands for the entire world ruled by Christ and to which He descended incarnate as man, as described at the beginning of the Gospel of St John: ""And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us."" If the dark exterior was a reminder of the inevitability of death, the wide, radiant interior with its saintly figures allowed the devout viewer to hope for salvation.Artistically, the triptych is very close to the Beaune Altarpiece. The head of the Virgin Mary, and in particular the head of Christ, are so like their counterparts in the picture of the Last Judgment that they must have been executed from the same cartoon (full-size design for a painting). It is not certain whether the work is entirely by Rogier's hand; the underdrawing reveals thin lines not at all typical of him, and perhaps done with a pen instead of Rogier's usual brush. There are also some differences in the artistic execution: the Virgin's face, for instance, looks waxen, and inflexible around the eyes by comparison with the wonderful, tenderly painted, and lifelike Mary Magdalene, which is among Rogier's finest works"	WEYDEN, Rogier van der	Braque Family Triptych	Oil on oak panel, 41 x 68 cm (central panel), 41 x 34 cm (wings each)	c. 1450	religious	Flemish	1401-1450

42289-0707vela.jpg	One of the tasks required of Velázquez, the court painter, was the painting of altarpieces, though to a lesser extent than painting portraits. The Coronation of the Virgin was painted around 1645, possibly for the queen's oratory in the Alcazar in Madrid. Angelic putti carry the virginal Madonna up to heaven on clouds; Christ and God the Father hold a wreath of roses over her head, and the dove of the Holy Ghost hovers above her in an aureole of light. The glory of the coronation of the Mother of God and her perfect features are signs of her virginity. The virginal face of the Madonna reflects the emotions aroused in Spain between 1613 and 1620 by the postulated Immaculate Conception of the Virgin. In this context Pacheco encouraged painters to create emphatically youthful depictions of Mary	VELÁZQUEZ, Diego Rodriguez de Silva y	The Coronation of the Virgin	Oil on canvas, 178 x 135 cm	1645	religious	Spanish	1601-1650

42968-1maggior1.jpg	This painting was commissioned by the Venetian government for the ceiling of the Sala del Maggior Consiglio of the Palazzo Ducale. It is one of the thirty five panels on the ceiling.Rising above the bank of clouds, the royally garbed personification of Venice sits enthroned between the twin towers of the city's Arsenal, about to be crowned with laurel by flying victories. Arrayed at her feet and offering her wise counsel are personifications of peace, abundance, fame, happiness, honour, security, and freedom. An especially splendid triumphal arch, fronted by twisting columns, marks the top of an enormous balcony which seems to burst through the ceiling into the ether beyond in order to accommodate the multitudes of celebrating people stipulated in the commission. At the base, Venice's smiling subjects seem undisturbed by the enormous size and energy of careening horsemen in their midst reminder of Venice's considerable military might. Illusionistic foreshortenings and dramatic light effects serve to give political allegory a previously unimagined dynamism and visual excitement	VERONESE, Paolo	Apotheosis of Venice	Oil on canvas, 904 x 579 cm	1585	mythological	Italian	1551-1600
00581-05pazzi.jpg	The Madonna and Child with Saints, that Andrea frescoed in the chapel in the castle of Trebbio (Val di Sieci), belonging to the Pazzi family, is influenced by Domenico Veneziano's peaceful and luminous painting. Despite the strong naturalism of the two saints on either side of the Madonna, the scene is characterized by a gentleness of forms, a delicacy of colour harmonies, and a majestic composition that Andrea had most probably borrowed from Veneziano's Carnesecchi Tabernacle and his frescoes in Sant'Egidio	ANDREA DEL CASTAGNO	Madonna and Child with Saints	Fresco, 290 x 212 cm	c. 1445	religious	Italian	1401-1450
12989-pepijn.jpg	Rubens, Van Dyck and Jordaens, often named in the same breath, are the most prominent artists of the Flemish Baroque. The trio dominated artistic life in the Southern Netherlands throughout the 17th century. All three made an enormous contribution to the fame of the city of Antwerp, but it is Rubens who bears the greatest authority, because he was the most versatile and talented.The youngest of the three great masters was Anthony van Dyck. He worked with Rubens for a time in his youth, after which he spent most of his career in England and Italy. He was even more admired in England than in his own country, and he had a significant influence upon English painting. Van Dyck's oeuvre, less varied than that of Rubens, consists mainly of brilliant portraits. His sensitive personality and restless temperament were brought to bear in penetrating psychological studies of members of leading families, the nobility and royalty. His sober Portrait of Marten Pepijn shows the artist as an energetic man of fifty-eight years, depicted in a black jerkin with a refined pleated collar.

10824-stvaast2.jpg	"Robert Campin, who is generally identified as the Master of Flémalle, had a workshop in Tournai from 1406 at the latest, and, as we know from several documents, it received many commissions from the city, various institutions, and private individuals. According to a document (which is a copy of old records of the painters' guild, dating from around 1482, that is to say some 50 years later) a certain Jacques Daret was an ""apprentice"" in the workshop at about the same time as Rogier van der Weyden; he joined it on 12 April 1427 and became a master on 18 October 1432. We do know, however, that Daret had already been working with Campin for over ten years, so he must have learned his trade as a painter long before 1427; the description ""apprenticeship"" cannot therefore be correct for him at this period. We may assume that both Daret and Van der Weyden completed their real apprenticeship earlier and they must have worked together in Campin's workshop around 1430 as trained painters.Four paintings executed by Campin's pupil Jacques Daret in 1434-35 for Jean du Clercq, abbot of St. Vaast in Arras, are extant and are unusually well documented. They originally ornamented the wings of an altar shrine decorated with alabaster sculptures. In these panels Daret shows himself a capable if not particularly innovative or sensitive artist, very closely related to Rogier and in particular to the Master of Flémalle. Daret's Visitation of Mary is so similar to Rogier's painting of the same subject (Museum der Bildende Künste, Leipzig)), which is certainly later, that we have to assume they had a common model. And Daret follows one picture from the ""Flémalle group"" so closely, the Nativity now in Dijon Museum, that it can almost be called a free copy.This kind of painting, which now appears mediocre in comparison with the works of masters such as Rogier van der Weyden, was still so new and unusual in its time that a chronicler tells us how the donor, Jean de Clercq, seen here kneeling on the left with his abbot's insignia, proudly showed this altarpiece wing to the participants in the peace conference negotiating the Treaty of Arras in 1435"	DARET, Jacques	Visitation	Oil on oak panel, 57 x 52 cm	1434-35	religious	Flemish	1451-1500
03554-agony_g.jpg	Though most of his activity took place in Mantua, Giuseppe Bazzani is usually ranged with the Settecento painters of Venice, owing to his stylistic relationship to them. His fluid brush-work, soft forms and fiery colours certainly show the influence of Venetian masters, but his dramatic expression and lively composition show greater individualism	BAZZANI, Giuseppe	The Agony of Christ in the Garden	Oil on canvas, 42 x 36 cm	-	religious	Italian	1701-1750
03600-4view.jpg	Frescoes in the oratories of brotherhoods are found throughout Italy. In 1516 to 1518 the Sienese brotherhood of Mary and Bernardino commissioned Girolamo del Pacchia, Sodoma, and Domenico Beccafumi to fresco the walls of their oratory with a cycle on the life of Mary, The artists painted two stories each: Pacchia, the Birth of Mary and the Annunciation; Sodoma, the Presentation of the Virgin and the Coronation of Mary; and Beccafumi, the Betrothal of Mary and the Death of the Virgin. The missing scenes on the right-hand longitudinal wall, the Visitation and the Assumption of the Virgin were not painted by Sodoma until the late 1520s, and Baccafumi's altarpiece still later, between 1535 and 1537. The cycle begins on the left wall (The Birth of Mary to THe Betrothal of Mary), and continues above the altar wall (Annunciation) and the right longitudinal wall (Visitation to Assumption of the Virgin) through the second of the short walls (The Coronation of Mary). In addition to the stories from the life of Mary, there are four frescoed standing figures of Franciscan saints in the corners of the longitudinal walls	BECCAFUMI, Domenico	View of the Oratory	Fresco	1520s	religious	Italian	1501-1550

23251-old_man.jpg	It is hypothesized that the painting depicts the Greek sculptor and royal portraitist, Praxiteles, contemplating the bust of Alexander the Great.

44258-oude2.jpg	About 1650 the most interesting developments in architectural painting took place in Delft, where a new phase began with the church interiors by Gerard Houckgeest, Emanuel de Witte, and Hendrick Cornelisz van Vliet. Stylistic affinities with works done during the decade in the city by Carel Fabritius, Pieter de Hooch, an Vermeer are apparent, and Vermeer's own exceptional masterpieces in this branch of painting can be viewed as part of the new movement.In Saenredam's earlier church interiors the line of vision is always at an angle of about 90&#176; to the centre of the nave or to the wall of the building he depicts. Houckgeest had the new idea  of shifting his position to the side to give an angle of about 45&#176; to the principal axis of the church. The new position creates intriguingly intricate diagonal views across the church. Emanuel de Witte experimented with similar perspectival schemes about 1650. His earliest dated interior that employs the new point of view is the Interior of the Oude Kerk at Delft during a Sermon. It does not focus on a tomb of a hero, but on the minister preaching from a pulpit, which is still in place, to a large congregation. In de Witte's painting the Word, not patriotism, is stressed	WITTE, Emanuel de	Interior of the Oude Kerk at Delft during a Sermon	Oil on wood, 61 x 44 cm	1651	interior	Dutch	1651-1700

44595-4muses1.jpg	The room dedicated to the Muses is highly theatrical. The ceiling seems to be held up by gigantic caryatids that appear on the walls. Muses with poets appear in the spaces between the caryatids, while personifications of rivers loom over the entrance doors.

12969-charllou.jpg	The sitter of this portrait is the young Prince Charles Louis (1617-1680), the nephew of King Charles I.

42233-0302vela.jpg	"In this painting the restriction of surrounding areas and the general pose found in earlier portraits of the king are still present, but the subject's whole attitude is more relaxed, the flesh tints, probably under the influence of Rubens, are painted with more fluidity, the accents of colour - eyes gleaming like black tortoiseshell, the golden lights on the waves of the hair - are placed with more emphasis, and shapes conveying Baroque dignity, such as the profuse folds of the red curtain, have made their way into the formerly sparse interior. Above all, Velázquez's new delight in luxuriant colour is reflected in his depiction of the silk embroidery and the silver and brown tones of the king's clothing.The king is holding in his right hand a paper with the inscription ""Senor/Diego Velázquez/ Pintor de V. Mg"" - the opening words of a petition to him from Velázquez.The unattractive matt white of the stockings is the result of an unskilful restoration of the picture in 1936, but otherwise the work is a good example of the skilled manner that Velázquez had now mastered"	VELÁZQUEZ, Diego Rodriguez de Silva y	Philip IV in Brown and Silver	Oil on canvas, 200 x 113 cm	1631-32	portrait	Spanish	1601-1650
36770-lochorst.jpg	The triptych was ordered in 1526 by Herman Lochorst, canon of the cathedral in Utrecht. The central panel depicts the Entry of Christ into Jerusalem. The interior wings present saints venerated in Utrecht: Agnes, Pope Cornelius, and Anthony on the left, Sebastian, Gertrude of Nivelles, and Christopher on the right. Of these figures, St Agnes is the most striking in her charming classical pose and the sheer, gauzelike chiton she wears.

27055-anatomy.jpg	This painting is one of the earliest of its kind in Dutch art. In composition these works could be considered the unsavoury counter-parts of civic-guard company portraits, which often depicts the officers around a table laden with food.The painting was commissioned by the surgeon's guild in Delft from the leading painter of the city, Michiel van Miereveld. It is specified in the Latin inscription on the railing that the painter's elder son, Pieter, actually carried out the painting following his father's design. No independent pictures by Pieter is known, and he died six years after working on the painting, at the age of twenty-seven	MIEREVELD, Michiel Jansz. van	Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Willem van der Meer	Oil on canvas, 144 x 198 cm	1617	genre	Dutch	1601-1650
41990-davidgol.jpg	This canvas closely follows Caravaggio's naturalistic approach, both in terms of form and content. A strong chiaroscuro governs the scene, highlighting the figure of David. The artist has created a compact group of half-length figures situated behind a table on which David has rested the decapitated head of Goliath, all set against a dark background which could be a wall and which serves to block any recession into depth, creating a very shallow foreground space	VALENTIN DE BOULOGNE	David with the Head of Goliath and Two Soldiers	Oil on canvas, 99 x 134 cm	1620-22	religious	French	1601-1650
06277-capture.jpg	The Royal Family Privateers owed their unusual name to the fact that each vessel was named after a member of the Royal Family. They carried out a series of dashing exploits in the 1740's, commanded by James Talbot, and several of these were painted by Brooking. This painting probably depicts the action on 10th July 1745 when the Prince Frederick and the Duke, under the command of Commodore James Talbot, captured two French vessels, the Marquese d'Antin and the Louis Erasme. The action was particularly celebrated since the French ships were found to have over one million pounds in bullion aboard. When the ships reached Bristol, the treasure was taken to London in 45 wagons, accompanied by an armed guard and preceded by a band	BROOKING, Charles	The Capture of a French Ship by Royal Family Privateers	Oil on canvas, 58 x 84 cm	-	historical	English	1701-1750

12966-charles2.jpg	This likeness of the king on horseback takes as its point of departure the archetypal image on the obverse of all the Great Seals of England: the sovereign as warrior. King Charles is wearing Greenwich-made armour and holding a commander's baton. A page carries his helmet. In keeping with the imperial claim of the inscription (in Latin on the tablet tied to the tree in this portrait: CAROLUS REX MAGNAE BRITANIAE - Charles King of Great Britain), the pose and woodland setting echo Titian's equestrian portrait of the Emperor Charles V at Muhlberg. (Titian's painting itself recalled the famous Roman bronze of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius on horseback.) Over his armour Charles wears a gold locket bearing the image of Saint George and the Dragon, the so-called Lesser George. He wore it constantly; it contained a portrait of his wife, and was with him the day he died. Here, however, it identifies him with the Order of the Garter of which Saint George was patron. As Garter Sovereign he is riding, like Charles V, at the head of his chivalrous knights in defence of the faith. In a profound sense the portrait is a visual assertion of Charles's claim to Divine Kingship. Albeit high above our heads - the horizon line ensures that our viewpoint is roughly at the level of his stirrup - his face is undistorted by foreshortening. Van Dyck's three-quarter view refines his features, and he bestrides his horse with a remote air of noble contemplation	DYCK, Sir Anthony van	Charles I on Horseback	Oil on canvas, 365 x 289 cm	c. 1635	portrait	Flemish	1601-1650

24073-3sposi04.jpg	One the most remarkable portions of the decoration of the Camera degli Sposi is the fictive oculus, or opening to the sky, located on the room's low ceiling. Created with sharp foreshortenings, the oculus is ringed with figures looking down on the room below; a potted plant is precariously perched on its wooden support, seemingly ready to fall at any moment. It is a brilliant tour de force that invariably engages the spectator, who must join in the game by standing directly beneath the circular trellis.The magnificent details of the ceiling and some of the busts and scenes stand among the most convincing trompe l'oeil passages of the entire Italian Renaissance	MANTEGNA, Andrea	Ceiling Oculus	Fresco, diameter: 270 cm	1465-74	religious	Italian	1451-1500

The beribboned document held by Franklin in the portrait is not a treaty or an Act of Parliament, but one of Alexander's deeds. The other books and pamphlets suggest the learned evidence brought in support of a wise man's decision.

07248-canal617.jpg	In this work and its companion picture (Capriccio: A Palladian Design for the Rialto Bridge, also in Parma) Canaletto created two of his most complex and intriguing capricci. He had already depicted an unrealised scheme for the Rialto Bridge, but in these works went one stage further and painted alternatives to the actual bridge surrounded by a sophisticated and extensive group of invented buildings.The bridge and extraordinary circular temple at the left appear to be almost entirely imaginary. Such spectacular flights of fancy may at root be based on reminiscences of details in works by Claude Lorraine (1600-82) and Giovanni Battista Piranesi (1720-78), but Canaletto has transformed possible sources of this type into a decorative creation all of his own.

37331-6orsini.jpg	"The altarpiece known as Passion Polyptych (or Orsini Polyptych), with panels now in a number of European museums (Angel of the Annunciation and Virgin of Annunciation, as well as Crucifixion and Deposition in Antwerp, the Road to Calvary in Paris and the Entombment in Berlin) is signed ""Pinxit Symon"" on the two panels of the Crucifixion and the Deposition. It presents several problems, both in terms of stylistic analysis and dating.Some scholars, stressing the fact that it is so different stylistically from all the other works of Simone's Avignon period (nervous lines and expressions), think that it may have been painted earlier and then transported to France; others believe that it may be a late work, commissioned by Napoleone Orsini, who died in the Curia in Avignon in 1342. Orsini's coat-of-arms appears in the background of the Road to Calvary.

39711-1ferra2.jpg	"In 1516 Titian made contact with Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara for whom he was to work for a decade on pictures destined for the Alabaster Chamber. In this period he painted a series of magnificent paintings of Dionysian themes: the Worship of Venus in the Prado, The Andrians (Bacchanalia), also in the Prado, and Bacchus and Ariadne, in the National Gallery, London. In these paintings Titian combines a richness of colouristic expression with a great formal elegance. These are the elements which characterize this whole so-called ""classic"" phase of Titian's development and which is dominated by the supreme masterpiece of the Frari Assumption of the Virgin.Titian's sources for the Bacchus and Ariadne were a variety of classical texts (especially Catullus and Ovid), all of them concerning Ariadne, the daughter of the king of Crete. Because of her love for Theseus, she helped him escape her father's labyrinth by means of a ball of thread. However, Theseus deserted her on Naxos while they were returning to Athens. There, she became the lover of the god Bacchus. Above her, already visible, is a crown of stars representing the ""Corona Borealis"", into which she (or, according to a different tradition, her bridal head-dress) is eventually transformed.This painting is among Titian's most Raphaelesque, particularly in the contrapposto of Ariadne and the controlled energy of Bacchus and his train, who seem more numerous than they really are. To achieve colouristic brilliance, Titian has used the strongest pigments then available on the market"	TIZIANO Vecellio	Bacchus and Ariadne	Oil on canvas, 175 x 190 cm	1520-22	mythological	Italian	1501-1550

18797-landscap.jpg	This painting belongs to a series of twelve pieces in the Budapest museum. The small pictures representing islands in the environs of Venice were formerly attributed to Francesco Guardi.

17722-209goya.jpg	La Caída and La Cucana belong to a series of seven paintings of 'country subjects' made to decorate the large gallery in the Duchess of Osuna's apartment in the Alameda Palace, the Osuna country residence outside Madrid known as El Capricho. The paintings were delivered on 22 April 1787. La Caída is described in Goya's account for the paintings submitted on 12 May 1787: 'an excursion in hilly country, with a woman in a faint after a fall from an ass; she is assisted by an abbot and another man who support her in their arms; two other women mounted on asses [and] expressing emotion and another figure of a servant form the main group and others who had fallen behind are seen in the distance, and a landscape to correspond.'Though on a smaller scale, this series of decorative paintings is similar in style and character to the tapestry cartoons; but unlike the tapestry cartoons it includes some scenes, such as La Caída, which appear to represent actual occurrences. It has been suggested that the fainting woman in La Caída is the Duchess of Osuna, that the figure supporting her is Goya and that the mounted woman weeping is the Duchess of Alba	GOYA Y LUCIENTES, Francisco de	The Fall (La Caída)	Oil on canvas, 169 x 100 cm	1786-87	genre	Spanish	1801-1850
40817-kingdrin.jpg	The subject is taken from the annual Flemish celebration of the Feast of Epiphany. The Feast of the Epiphany or Three Kings (Matthew 2:1-12) was celebrated on the 6th January, and was usually the occasion of a large family dinner. The evening began with the proclamation of a 'king', chosen by lot. This was often done by the concealment of a bean in a large cake, and the person in whose portion it was found would preside over the festivities. The subject was particularly popular among artists, notably the Flemish painter Jacob Jordaens, who painted it several times, and in most cases, as here, the role of the 'King' is appropriately played by the eldest member of the company.The painting has in the past been attributed to the Utrecht painter Jan Gerritsz. van Bronckhorst. However, stylistically the painting is closer to the work of Haarlem painters such as Jan Miense Molenaer and Judith Leyster, in whose circle such subjects seem to have enjoyed a particular vogue	UNKNOWN MASTER, Dutch	The King Drinks!

A feeling of distance is produced by the dark brown passages at the front. Late seventeenth-century landscapes, such as those of Pieter Gysels, perhaps, may have stimulated this view	THIELE, Johann Alexander	View of Dresden from the Loessnitz Heights	Oil on canvas, 103 x 156 cm	1751	landscape	German	1701-1750
25344-adoratio.jpg	In this work by Mazzolino the sharpness of line typical of the North European tradition is evident. Observe the 'linea serpentinata' with which the fragile figures are constructed.

37499-stillif.jpg	Frans Snyders, Rockox's friend and neighbour and a witness to his last will and testament, was the leading still-life and animal painter of his time. His fruitful career was linked in close symbiosis with the artistic world of Rubens, with whom he frequently collaborated. Both the paintings Snyders made alone and those he produced in collaboration with Rubens are so intimately bound up with Rubens' ideas and language of form that they have to be appreciated in this context. Just as in Rubens' work, Snyders assembles the elements of his paintings not only on the basis of their artistic characteristics, but also as elements with a part to play in the overall design and decorative effect of the canvas as a whole. The luxuriant Still-Life is a representative example of Snyders' oeuvre	SNYDERS, Frans	Still-Life	Oil on panel, 74 x 105 cm	1616	still-life	Flemish	1601-1650

Decades previously, Daubigny had bought a plot of land there and tempted Daumier and Corot to follow him. Van Gogh had a tendency to follow in someone or other's footsteps, and in Auvers it was an easy and natural thing to do	GOGH, Vincent van	Houses in Auvers	Oil on canvas, 61 x 73 cm	June 1890, Auvers-sur-Oise	landscape	Dutch	1851-1900
26351-poultry.jpg	Market and kitchen scenes originally came from Flemish painting and above all are linked in the sixteenth century with Pieter Aertsen and Joachim Beuckelaer. In sharp contrast to Dutch still-life specialists, the Leiden Feinmalers around Gerard Dou reactivated these subjects for their small-format genre paintings, in which market goods were showed off to their best advantage in small, select groups. Metsu's Poultry Seller depicts just such a group of varied items, arranged along the painting's lower and left-hand margins; the precision with which they have been painted testifies to a supreme virtuosity in the Feinmaler style, and is accentuated in part by the use of light and dark contrasts. But importantly, each surface receives the same amount of attention: from different woods - a bamboo rod, basketwork, a barrel and a bare tree &#151; to the fluffy fur of the rabbit beside the pale flesh of the plucked hen in the basket, or from the bird's skeletal head, a strong contrast with the luminous red head of the turkey, to the trader's thick wool stockings that differ so from his young customer's delicate, filmy gauze apron. Metsu is not simply content, however, to use the Feinmalers' technique of applying flat, narrow brush strokes one beside the next. The tree and the row of houses in the background reveal his command of a far more relaxed and expansive style. Furthermore, his colours are richer than those of the Leiden Feinmaler, and reveal a love of clear reds, blues and greens demonstrated, for instance, in the young woman's clothes	METSU, Gabriel	The Poultry Seller	Oil on oak panel, 62 x 46 cm	1662	genre	Dutch	1651-1700

32954-08isaiah.jpg	A new fresco occupied Raphael during the period 1511-1512: the Prophet Isaiah painted for Johannes Goritz of Luxemburg, Head Chancellor of the Papal Court. That the work was commissioned by a foreigner is indicative of the extraordinary fame that Raphael had acquired. This powerful but composed prophet and the putti who surround him echo Michelangelo's figures in the Sistine Ceiling. Nonetheless, the putti, whose glances and poses are enlivened by a strong spiritual tension, are transformed by Raphael into tender and formally controlled children. Even the action of the wind that blows Isaiah's mantle is a life-giving device rather than an expression of dramatic feeling. The dedicatory inscription in Greek (which alludes to St Anne, patron of Goritz) and the Hebrew scroll which the Prophet holds, reflect the learned environment in which the work was conceived.According to Vasari, Raphael repainted it after seeing Michelangelo's prophets. The fresco in later centuries was repainted several times and restored in 1960	RAFFAELLO Sanzio	The Prophet Isaiah	Fresco, 250 x 155 cm	1511-12	religious	Italian	1501-1550
07237-canal606.jpg	This attractive view of the Forum comes from the same series of paintings as The Arch of Constantine. Like the other three works from the group it is prominently signed and dated.The Forum was the site of the political and religious centre of ancient Rome; attempts to excavate it were made throughout the eighteenth century, and the ruins revealed were consistently revered by visitors to the city. The tourists shown here mainly scrutinize the remains of the temple of Castor and Pollux which dominates the foreground. One man, at the right, is so intent upon the ruin that he appears to be ignoring the cleric in black who is attempting to converse with him. Further back, at the left, between the columns can be seen a knife grinder, and over towards the right, the Temple of Saturn. Rising up above it is the Palazzo Senatorio which dominates the Capitoline Hill. These topographical elements have been depicted with considerable care, but elsewhere the artist has taken liberties with his subject - some of the houses at the left are invented, and their chimneys appear characteristically Venetian, rather than Roman.

05757-nicolas.jpg	During a famine, St Nicholas lodged with an inn-keeper who had murdered three children and salted down their dismembered bodies to feed his guests. Nicholas miraculously restored them to life. The story is thought to have arisen out of another concerning three soldiers who were saved by Nicholas from being unjustly executed. In medieval stained glass the soldiers stand in a tower representing their prison. As was the custom, the saint's stature was greatly enlarged in relation to the other figures, which therefore were the size of children, beside him. In due course, when the original legend was forgotten, the story of the school-children was invented to explain the discrepancy in size	BOULLOGNE, Bon	St Nicholas Resuscitates the Children	Oil on canvas, 63 x 39 cm	-	religious	French	1651-1700

23989-3adorat2.jpg	A prodigy, Andrea Mantegna established his reputation when he was barely 20 years old. This painting is an early work, but already his highly individual style is evident. The hard, precise drawing, the astonishing clarity of even the smallest details in the distant landscape, and the refined, pure colour are typical of his work, as are the intensely serious expressions of the figures. The Adoration seems to have been painted for Borso d'Este, ruler of Ferrara, and the coarse realism of the shepherds probably reflects Flemish paintings collected by the Este.In this scene the realistic portrayal of the two shepherds in ragged clothing betrays Flemish influence.

According to one version in the Bible, at the end of his reign Saul throws himself upon his sword. According to another version, Saul, leaning on a spear asks a passing Amalekite to kill him. Salviati brings both together in the fresco and shows Saul, pierced by the sword and lying on the ground, as well as the Amalekite, who is pulling out his weapon.In the small image above the battle scene, Salviati depicts Samuel Anoints David.

18582-04mock.jpg	Grünewald's earliest datable work is the Mocking of Christ, a colourful, vehemently expressive painting demonstrating his ability to create dazzling light effects. The painting depicts Christ blindfolded and being beaten by a band of grotesque men. The figures are thick-bodied, soft, and fleshy, done in a manner suggestive of the Italian High Renaissance. Elements of the work also show Grünewald's assimilation of Dürer, specifically his Apocalypse series. Different from High Renaissance idealism and humanism, however, are Grünewald's uses of figural distortion to portray violence and tragedy, thin fluttering drapery, highly contrasting areas of light and shadow, and unusually stark and iridescent colour. It is these elements, already in evidence in this early work, that Grünewald was to develop into the masterful, individualistic style most fully realized in his Isenheim Altarpiece	GRÜNEWALD, Matthias	The Mocking of Christ	Oil on pine panel, 109 x 73,5 cm	1503	religious	German	1501-1550
06177-01right.jpg	The picture shows the right wing of the Dijon Altarpiece.The most distinctive aspect of the Dijon Altarpiece is the arrangement of the sacred architectural settings which occupy virtually all of two out of the four scenes. At the moment of the Annunciation, Mary is sitting in a small pavilion attached to a much larger and much grander building behind. The slender rib vaults, the two windows surmounted by clover-leaf tracery, and the rectangular paving mark the style as Gothic. But the relationship between the pavilion and the surrounding space is unusual, as is the way the room is opened out on two sides in order to afford an unimpeded view of the Virgin.The same is true of the temple in the Presentation of Christ. The Holy Family, St Simeon and a servant girl, who carries a candle in her right hand and a basket with two doves in her left, all gather round the Christ Child. Again, the building in which they stand is open onto the world outside, as if the painter were trying to show us both interior and exterior simultaneously. This apparent contradiction is a convention which Broederlam has borrowed from the paintings of the Italian Trecento, where similar buildings are to be found in the works of Giotto and Ambrogio Lorenzetti, among others	BROEDERLAM, Melchior	Presentation in the Temple and Flight to Egypt	Tempera on wood, 167 x 125 cm	1393-99	religious	Flemish	1351-1400

Here the goddess Venus tries in vain to persuade her mortal lover Adonis to refrain from taking part in the dangerous hunt, but in the background we see Adonis having been slain during the hunt.This painting is regarded as one of Bloemaert's masterpieces. The harmony, the intensity of the colours, and the lustre of the classical figures against the contrasting landscape behind it testifies to the quality and longevity. In creating the composition, Bloemaert could look for inspiration in great artists such as Titian and Rubens, who had already painted the motif	BLOEMAERT, Abraham	Venus and Adonis	Oil on canvas, 134 x 191 cm	1632	mythological	Dutch	1601-1650
08723-desdemon.jpg	The painting takes its themes from Shakespeare, borrowing the composition that Chassériau established in the eighth of the Othello prints that he engraved in 1844.

00418-4saints2.jpg	The first two pictures, dedicated to St Catherine, are in very poor condition; they show the saint appearing before Emperor Maxentius to condemn idolatry and her dispute with the philosophers summoned by the emperor and their conversion. These scenes are followed by the picture of an angel intervening to prevent Catherine's torture on the wheel and the beheading of the saint. Both scenes have parallels in the St George cycle, here, however, an oriental milieu, seen in the physiognomies, head coverings, and scimitars, is emphasized still more	ALTICHIERO da Zevio	The Beheading of St Catherine	Fresco	1378-84	religious	Italian	1351-1400
40899-10sorrow.jpg	The representation is a development of the Man of Sorrows either or not in the company of the Virgin. As mourning emblems of the Deposition the figures of the Virgin Mary, John, Mary Magdalene and a holy woman are grouped around the dead body of Christ, who is nevertheless showing his wounds like a living person. It is a devotional subject. Two angels are holding the sponge and the lance. Under the Cross are the instruments and symbols of the Passion, such as the ladder, the Flagellation column, the scourge, Judas' silver coins, the holy women's vases, the hammer and the dice.The painting is the work of an anonymous Memling follower.

33534-45portra.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 101.Rembrandt married on June 22, 1634. His bride was Saskia Uylenburgh (born in 1612), the cousin of Hendrick Uylenburgh and the daughter of the burgomaster of Leeuwarden. Saskia brought a substantial dowry as well as patrician status with her, so this marriage represented a substantial climb in social status for Rembrandt.Saskia was to be the subject of the largest number of single portraits during the 1630s. Rembrandt posed her in mythological dress, particularly in the flower-draped abundance of the goddess Flora (1634), and in formal attire with fastidious profile. But he also delighted in using her as his subject in a cluster of spontaneous domestic drawings, such as those catching her leaning out of a window or lying in bed. Some of the unhappy biographical data make the scenes in bed poignant: Saskia lost three children before the birth of a son, Titus, in 1641.

The last two customers at the café are seated in the right-hand part of the painting, with the gray reflection of the street behind them.  The couple is surrounded by emptiness. The actress Ellen Andrée and the engraver Marcellin Desboutin served as models, but the painting goes beyond a mere portrait.

08170-pyrrha.jpg	The story of a great flood occurs in the mythology of many races. The Greek version (Met. 1:348-415) tells of Deucalion, son of Prometheus, who, like Noah, escaped the destruction that overtook the rest of mankind by building an ark in which he floated for nine days with his wife Pyrrha. After the waters had subsided they were advised by an oracle to veil their heads and 'throw the bones of your great mother behind you', which they took to mean the rocks of Mother Earth. They did as they were bid, the rocks which Deucalion threw turning into men and Pyrrha's into women. Thus a new human race was created.In the painting Pyrrha and Deucalion are shown in the act of casting the rocks. On the ground rocks change into men and women who scramble to their feet	CASTIGLIONE, Giovanni Benedetto	Pyrrha and Deucalion	Oil on canvas, 83 x 107 cm	1655	mythological	Italian	1601-1650

31066-2august3.jpg	In 1454 Piero agreed to paint a polyptych for the Augustinians of Borgo San Sepolcro; the painting was to be finished within eight years and was intended for their monastery. As usual, the work was not completed until much later. The polyptych later dismembered and the panels were scattered. It was only in the twentieth century that scholars succeeded in reconstructing this work. Among the parts of the polyptych that have unfortunately not survived there is also the central panel which represented the Virgin Enthroned.St John the Evangelist was one of the four side panels depicting four saints (St Augustine and St Michael at the left side and St John the Evangelist and St Nicholas of Tolentino at the right).Against a background which is a realistically constructed space with a marble balustrade stands the figure of St John. It is dynamic yet elegant. His lined face, surrounded by white hair, his bony hand weighted down by the heavy book, even the ornate borders of the garment that unexpectedly shows through under the wide cloak, are elements that stand out and appear to force their way through Piero's earlier sense of measure.The bright colours on this panel are the result of a recent restoration	PIERO DELLA FRANCESCA	Polyptych of St Augustine: St John the Evangelist	Tempera on panel, 132 x 58 cm	c. 1460	religious	Italian	1451-1500

37552-scene33.jpg	Scene 33 of the cycle on the life of St Benedict depicts as Benedict gives posthumous absolution to two nuns, fleeing from their graves during Mass, whom he had threatened with excommunication.One notable scene of the cycle is devoted to the story of two haughty and talkative nuns whom Benedict had threatened with excommunication (Scene 33). Both died soon afterward, and during Mass their nurse saw how they rose up out of their graves and fled from the church. Benedict promptly administered the host to the errant souls, thereby luring them back into the bosom of the community.The composition of this scene is clearly indebted to Pinturicchio's cycle in the Piccolomini Library in Siena. The shape of the interior and arrangement of the picture space are borrowed from the scene of Enea Silvio Piccolomini's coronation as Pius II, whereas the grouping of figures, especially that of the ones seen from the back in the foreground, recall the scene in which Piccolomini is elevated to the rank of cardinal	SODOMA, Il	Life of St Benedict, Scene 33: Benedict Gives Posthumous Absolution to Two Nuns	Fresco	1505-08	religious	Italian	1501-1550
04026-4buda.jpg	"Benczúr started to paint ""The Recapture of Buda Castle in 1686"" in 1885; the composition was completed for the Millennial Celebrations in 1896. This huge painting was the last such venture of Benczúr and of Hungarian Historical painting in general, since by the turn of the century this genre became out of date. The composition implies the historical necessity of the Austro-Hungarian Empire by emphasizing that Hungary was freed from Turkish suzerainty in 1686-1687 by the help of Karl of Lotharingia and Eugene of Savoy. Benczúr groups the figures ingeniously; thus, in spite of the numerous characters, the presentation still remains fluent. The careful studies of costumes, props and faces, and their realistic and colourful rendering, were required to establish the historical authenticity of the final work"	BENCZÚR, Gyula	The Recapture of Buda Castle in 1686	Oil on canvas, 356 x 705 cm	1896	historical	Hungarian	1851-1900

42266-0601vela.jpg	As a court painter, Velázquez was required to paint group portraits as well as these actual or fictional portraits of individual figures. He organized a workshop of competent artists, and in 1633 recruited the services of his son-in-law Juan Bautista Martínez del Mazo. Mazo probably did a good deal of work on the picture of around 1636 showing Prince Baltasar Carlos with the Count-Duke of Olivares at the Royal Mews. The Count-Duke stands in the middle ground to the right of the picture, with his master-at-arms; figures on the balcony above him include Philip IV, Queen Isabel and several courtiers who cannot be identified for certain.The belly of the horse on which the little prince is mounted is disproportionately convex and in fact so coarsely depicted that one suspects the unskilful hand of an apprentice rather than a deliberate distortion	VELÁZQUEZ, Diego Rodriguez de Silva y	Prince Baltasar Carlos with the Count-Duke of Olivares at the Royal Mews	Oil on canvas, 144 x 96,5 cm	c. 1636	other	Spanish	1601-1650

He made drawings and oil paintings of the parental gardens as well as the street façade and the garden façade of the parsonage.From the garden of the parsonage there was a good view of the tower of the old ruined village church. This old tower standing alone in the middle of the field appeared in the earliest works which van Gogh painted in Nuenen. He was greatly attracted to this sturdy ruin, which he could see from the house and which he painted and drew on many occasions	GOGH, Vincent van	The Parsonage Garden at Nuenen in Spring	Oil on paper on panel, 25 x 57 cm	May 1884, Nuenen	landscape	Dutch	1851-1900

Theodosius impetuously thrusts his face upwards towards the saint. Ambrose's sturdy vigour has been transferred to the crozier as if the priest who holds it for the saint were ready to bring it crashing down on the emperor.This painting is a free copy by Van Dyck of a large painting now in Vienna executed in Rubens's studio.

29201-11munkac.jpg	Munkácsy often spent the summer at his wife's estate in Colpach. Colpach Castle, located in Colpach-Bas near Ell in western Luxembourg, dates from the beginning of the 14th century. The castle was originally a small medieval stronghold surrounded by a moat, it was adapted as a manor house in the 18th century. In about 1870, Baron Edouard de Marches, the first husband of Munkácsy's wife, laid out the gardens surrounding the castle. Munkácsy and his wife spent their summers in Colpach Castle and the winters in Paris.Munkácsy painted this landscape in Colpach. Partially  owing to the influence of László Paál, Munkácsy's landscape painting started to bloom during the 1880s. This painting is also closely related to Paál's intimate and lyrical landscapes. The light is sifting through the foliage, radiating intimacy: the multitude of hues and tones within the brown basic colour make the painting exciting	MUNKÁCSY, Mihály	Line of Trees	Oil on canvas, 112 x 182 cm	1886	landscape	Hungarian	1851-1900

14089-ursins.jpg	This is the portrait of Fouquet's that most strongly reflects the spirit of the Renaissance. The subject of the portrait was a powerful lord, the Chancellor of France of both Charles VII and Louis XI, one of the leading notabilities of France. The background, composed of Renaissance architecture with lavish gilded panellings inlaid with marble fillings displays an Italian influence. Against this background the monumental figure of the Chancellor kneels in prayer before a lectern, on which a great folio lies open on a cushion of red, white and yellow stripes. The red of his robe, trimmed with brown fur at the neck and sleeves, is reflected in the heavy, fleshy face of the Chancellor, on his thin lips, and on the head, which combines an overall impression of strength, intelligence and extraordinary dignity. The decorative harmony of the red and gold in which his head is framed only serves to enhance the imposing effect of the whole figure. With this portrait Fouquet earns his place as a fit contemporary of the great masters of the Italian Quattrocento, Andrea Mantegna, Piero della Francesca and Antonello da Messina	FOUQUET, Jean	Portrait of Guillaume Jouvenel des Ursins	Wood, 93 x 73 cm	c. 1455	portrait	French	1451-1500

It is an attractive work with a harmonious landscape. The foreground and background merge gradually with one another, forbidding rocks give way to a grand valley, in which the mythological scene forms a balanced component.Ovid describes (Met. 5:250-268) how Minerva visited the Muses on Mt Helicon, their home, to listen to their song and story and to see the sacred spring, the Hippocrene, which flowed from a rock after it had been struck by the hoof of the winged horse, Pegasus.

41386-10colom1.jpg	The three panels in the Brera painted by an anonymous follower of Giotto, representing scenes from the life of St Colomba, belonged to a triptych, probably executed for the old cathedral of Rimini, dedicated to St Colomba and demolished in 1815. According to a plausible theory that is not universally accepted by scholars, the panels belonged to a double-faced composition placed on the high altar of the cathedral. Other panels of this work are in the Musée Jacquemart-André, Paris; the Galleria Sabauda, Turin; and the Friedenthal collection, Ingenheim.St Colomba, the virgin of Sens, was martyred during the reign of the Emperor Aurelian. Confined in a house of prostitution, she was rescued from dishonour by a bear. The same animal saved her again when an attempt was made to kill her by burning down the cell in which she was locked. Finally, the Emperor - instigated by the devil - had her dragged out of town, where she was beheaded by the soldiers.In the three small panels in the Brera, the main episodes in this legend are represented with subtle variations in composition and rhythm. In St Colomba before the Emperor the courtyard is shown frontally, and the foreshortening of the architecture does not follow a unified perspective scheme. The splaying out of the sides appears to enlarge the ground on which the motionless figures stand	UNKNOWN MASTER, Italian	Scenes from the Life of St Colomba (St Colomba before the Emperor)	Tempera on panel, 55 x 55 cm	c. 1340	religious	Italian	1301-1350
04685-portgent.jpg	During the eighteenth century portraiture in Rome developed a distinctive, cosmopolitan style as practitioners from outside the city dominated the field: the Frenchman Pierre Subleyras, the Lucchese Pompeo Batoni, the Bohemian Anton Raphael Mengs and Austrian Anton von Maron. One reason for this diversity was Rome's prominence as a place of artistic and educational pilgrimage for young artists and travellers from other European nations undertaking the 'Grand Tour'.The painting probably depicts a foreign visitor to Rome proudly holding a book, a prop suggestive of both learning and the implicit educational function of travel in the mid-eighteenth century.The portrait is illustrative of both the distinctive Roman style and mode of 'Grand Tour' portraiture	BLANCHET, Louis-Gabriel	Portrait of a Gentleman	Oil on canvas, 99 x 74 cm	-	portrait	French	1701-1750

12498-12krel.jpg	"Inscription in the top left by someone else (?): OSWOLT KREL 1499.This portrait comes from the collection of the Princes Oettingen-Wallerstein, who had acquired it in 1812; if has been in its present location since 1928. It is presumed that Oswolt Krell, a merchant for the Ravensburg House in Nuremberg from 1495 to 1503, had asked the artist for a true portrait of representation. Its notable size, similar to that adopted by Dürer for the portrait of his father two years earlier, and its setting, a half-length, suggests this. In this way, it differs from the Tucher portraits, which were intended for private use.The background, as in the Tucher portraits (Schlossmuseum, Weimar), is divided between the curtain and landscape passage, unlike those, however, it is divided rather unevenly. The bright red curtain is wide and occupies most of the space on the right; the landscape, on the left, is reduced to a foreshortening that shows a small part of a river that meanders toward the back, behind a group of tall trees. The windowsill that separated the subject from the landscape in the Tucher paintings is absent. The figure represented, set with obvious grandiosity, is found in front of the curtain, highlighted by intense colour.The large fur-lined cloak is casually placed on the right shoulder only, to show, on the left side, the rich black garment with the puffed sleeve. To the disorderly folds of the cloak correspond the parallel horizontal folds of the sleeve and the vertical ones of the garment. The three-quarter position allows the painter to bring out the quality of the attire: the fur, silk shirt, and gold chain. The careful, fastidious representation of these meaningful details creates a powerful foundation for the setting of the head: vigorous, strong features, the pronounced nose and the strong-willed mouth, the furrowed eyebrows, as if from a sudden start or fright that makes him direct his gaze off to the side behind him. Everything works to make his face threateningly severe, which even the soft, light brown hair framing him does not attenuate. To the energetic expression of the face corresponds the nervous look of his left hand clutching his cloak and that of the contraction of the knotted fingers of the right hand that leans on an invisible window sill.Colour, form, and proportion heighten the expression of supreme resolution, an expression that is the result of a serious psychological study that Dürer conducted on the merchant, who was the same age as the artist and who was later to become the mayor of Lindau, his native city.The two side panels that represent two ""sylvan men"" are wings to the portrait. They bear the heraldic shields of the subject and his wife, Agathe von Esendorf. They originally let the portrait be closed from the retro; one could imagine, then, that despite the large dimensions, the painting was to be conserved closed.

07251-canal701.jpg	Canaletto is first recorded in England in spring 1746, and his earliest paintings of London are depictions of the new Westminster Bridge, a subject he was to portray from various vantage points. The bridge was not actually completed until four years after this work was painted.In this picture he combines a view of its whole span with a depiction of festivities, which, although tamer than the Venetian spectacles he generally painted, partially recall them. The celebrations accompanied the appointment of the new Lord Mayor of London. The largest City Barge is shown taking him to Westminster Hall, by the Abbey at the right, where he will be sworn in. The prominent building on the horizon to the left of it is St John's Church, Smith Square, and over on the other side of the river is Lambeth Palace, the London home of the Archbishop of Canterbury. All the other spectacular barges are those of the different city guilds (Skinners, Goldsmiths, Fishmongers, Clothworkers, Vinters, Merchant Taylors, Mercers and Dyers); a number of them are firing salutes to honour the Mayor. In order to encapsulate all of this activity within such a broad panorama Canaletto has adopted an imaginary vantage point high above the Thames	CANALETTO	London: Westminster Bridge from the North on Lord Mayor's Day	Oil on canvas, 96 x 137,5 cm	1746	landscape	Italian	1701-1750

He preferred to work as an architect and a designer of forfications, as in his work at Urbino, and he collaborated on the building of Siena cathedral. He also wrote a treatise on civil and military architecture.His painted oeuvre is sporadic, and employs a soft and delicate style which may recall Botticelli, although some experts have seen the influence of Verrocchio in the lightness, grace and elegance of the poses, together with the high degree of finish	FRANCESCO DI GIORGIO MARTINI	Madonna and Child with Two Angels	Panel, 73 x 46 cm	1465-66	religious	Italian	1451-1500
25971-04notri.jpg	Memling must have started work on his wide Adoration of the Magi triptych shortly after finishing the Portinari panels. This altarpiece too was probably commissioned by Abbot Jan Crabbe, as the old woman and young man from the earlier Crucifixion triptych once again appear together. Like the Last Judgment, this triptych relies on both Van der Weyden and Lochner, despite its highly personal, peculiar and ceremonial atmosphere. The conception of the work owes a great deal to Rogier's Columba altarpiece (Munich, Alte Pinakothek), which Memling must have seen during production in the master's workshop. Meanwhile, the highly centralized, symmetrical composition looks back to Stefan Lochner's even earlier Dombild (Cologne, Cathedral) .The triptych depicts the Nativity (left), the Adoration of the Magi (central) and the Presentation of the Temple (right)	MEMLING, Hans	Triptych	Oil on wood, 96,4 x 147 cm (central), 98 x 63,5 cm (each wing)	c. 1470	religious	Flemish	1451-1500

34181-0taste.jpg	Ribera's stay in Rome lasted only a few years. Only a handful of pictures from his Roman period has been identified, of which the most important is a set of the Five Senses, supposedly made for a Spanish client. The Sense of Taste, which typifies these pictures, is an ingenious representation of a theme made popular in the Netherlands during the late sixteenth century. Northern artists treated the subject as an allegory with classicising figures. However, Ribera rejects this model and takes a direct, naturalistic approach, embodying the sense of taste  in a beefy, gluttonous type, poised to descent on a bowl of pasta and wash  it down with a jug of wine	RIBERA, Jusepe de	Sense of Taste	Oil on canvas, 117 x 88 cm	1613-16	mythological	Spanish	1601-1650
34303-maruce03.jpg	The largest room on the ground floor is the Sala d'Ercole, a hall with two window bays. It has three entrances and presents an elaborate painted decoration extending across all four walls and the entire ceiling. The decoration was executed with the collaboration of Giuseppe Tonelli (1668-1732), one of the best known quadratura painters in Florence. The pictorial program contains the Labours and Apotheosis of Hercules.A simple, rhythmic arrangement of columns, backed by a gilt ground, structures all four walls in the room. On three sides it is interrupted by a large, arched centre opening. The compositions for these imaginary openings are three of Hercules's more significant labours. Prominent on the end wall is the depiction of the young Hercules at the Crossroads between Vice and Virtue, the other two openings contains Hercules and Cacus, and Hercules and Nessus. On the window wall a painted sculpture depicting Hercules and Antheus can be found.In the Sala d'Ercole Ricci's fluid, elegant, and atmospheric style attains a brilliance and airiness that set him apart from all his famous contemporaries, and has been shown to anticipate features of Rococo painting	RICCI, Sebastiano	Hercules at the Crossroads	Fresco	1706-07	mythological	Italian	1701-1750

22614-01annun.jpg	The provenance of this panel has been connected to the Church of Sant'Egidio in Florence. At some point, the painting was probably cut down on the left side. On the basis of the hypothetical identification of the portrayed donors as Andrea and Lorenzo d'Ilarione de' Bardi, early scholars assumed that the picture could date to no earlier than 1452, and more likely to a bit later. Successive art historians have moved the painting to the early 1440's, comparing it to the Annunciation in Munich and recognizing in it the beginnings of Lippi's attachment to the style of Fra Angelico. The participation of Andrea del Castagno has also been suggested, with a date of around 1440. The portraits of the donors, more recently identified as Folco Portinari and Folgonaccio, were probably carried out with the help of an assistant	LIPPI, Fra Filippo	Annunciation with two Kneeling Donors	Oil on panel, 155 x 144 cm	c. 1440	religious	Italian	1401-1450

05281-8lastjud.jpg	The triptych of the Last Judgment is a fascinating work of art which comes surprisingly close to the unmistakable style of the strange moralist from 's-Hertogenbosch. The emphasis in the development of the theme is on the all-besetting evil and perennial human stupidity that render the world a hell even before the day of divine jjudgment. The extraordinary combination of motifs is often derived from vernacular symbolism and imagery: The inventive use of colours and the sharp, supple brushwork have persuaded many critics that Bosch himself was the author of this painting. In spite of the work's pictorial qualities, several factors seem to undermine this attribution. Nevertheless, the triptych remains an important example of Boschian invention. It dates from the early sixteenth century.At the time of his death, Bosch was internationally celebrated as an eccentric painter of religious visions who dealt in particular with the torments of hell. During his lifetime Bosch's works were in the inventories of noble families of the Netherlands, Austria, and Spain, and they were imitated in a number of paintings and prints throughout the 16th century, especially in the works of Pieter Bruegel the Elder.

In the rows at the front kneeling angels make music, in those at the back the looks and gestures of those present are oriented towards the central event.Both the highly packed hosts of angels praising the Virgin and the huge figures in the central panel indicate that considerable assistance was needed for this work.

Munkácsy had followed the life of his hero in his earliest genre pictures painted in 1867 or illustrations for journals. He needed an immense amount of skill in order to paint a true picture of a man condemned to death who had been given proper food and looked after for three days, and then his family, friends and enemies were to come to say good-bye to him. His wife is sobbing her heart out in a corner, his little daughter is pottering about not knowing what is going on and she is munching something.

12486-01father.jpg	The portrait is inscribed `1497 Albrecht Dürer the Elder at age 70'. Dürer's father appears considerably older than in the portrait of seven years earlier. His lips are thinner, his face more heavily lined with wrinkles and his narrow eyes have a wearier appearance. Yet Albrecht the Elder has retained his wisdom and dignity. After his death, Dürer wrote that his father `passed his life in great toil and stern, hard labour...He underwent manifold afflictions, trials and adversities.' Albrecht the Elder died five years after this portrait was painted, at the age of 75.The condition of this painting is poor, particularly in the background and the cloak, and in the past many scholars believed that it was a copy of a lost original. However, since it was cleaned in 1955, there has been more support for the view that this is indeed the original. Fortunately the face is the part of the picture which remains in the best condition.This portrait may originally have been displayed with Dürer's self-portrait of the following year, either hung in the same room in the family home or even linked as a diptych. Although Dürer and his father are wearing very different clothing and the backgrounds do not match, the two portraits are almost the same size and the half length poses are similar. The pictures were apparently kept together as a pair, since they were presented by the city of Nuremberg to the Earl of Arundel in 1636 as a gift for Charles I of England. Both paintings were sold in 1650 by Cromwell. The portrait of Albrecht Dürer the Elder stayed in Britain and was eventually bought by the National Gallery in 1904	DÜRER, Albrecht	Portrait of Dürer's Father at 70	Oil on panel, 51 x 40 cm	1497	portrait	German	1501-1550
26361-writing2.jpg	Metsu's indisputable masterpieces are Man Writing a Letter and Woman Reading a Letter which were painted as companion pieces. In both paintings, the way the silvery daylight flows over the figures set against light walls is not surpassed by Vermeer. The pendants offer a small drama: the handsome man writes a letter, and its patient recipient attentively reads it by the light of a window. Here letter writing and reading are most likely associated with love. The discreet waiting maid pulls aside a curtain hanging from a rod to reveal a choppy seascape, possibly but not demonstrably a reference to the popular adage that love is as hazardous as a sea voyage. The maid's momentary movement contrasts with the concentration of the young woman who, one senses, will not move until she has finished reading the letter.The curtain over the painting is not an unusual detail. The Dutch often protected paintings with curtains, either to keep off the light and dust, or to look at them only occasionally, as is the traditional way of the Chinese and, Japanese - a practice that comes from the fine feeling that a work of art cannot be looked at continually. Trompe l'oeil curtains on rods painted to give the illusion that they have been drawn aside to reveal a framed picture are not uncommon either; best known is the one Rembrandt included in his intimate Holy Family at Kassel	METSU, Gabriel	Woman Reading a Letter	Oil on panel, 53 x 40 cm	1662-65	interior	Dutch	1651-1700

41361-07sancta.jpg	Sts Lawrence and Stephen were venerated throughout Rome and the popes accorded them particular honour. Their martyrdoms were frescoed in the private papal chapel known as the Sancta Sanctorum (Holy of Holies) in the Lateran Palace, the official residence of the popes through the end of the Great Schism. The chapel was commissioned by Pope Nicholas III (reigned 1276-80). It preserved the miraculous, painted portrait of Christ, believed to have been completed by angels, and some of the most treasured relics from the Holy Land, including a coal from the fire that roasted Lawrence and drops of Stephen's blood	UNKNOWN MASTER, Italian	Martyrdom of St Stephen and Martyrdom of St Lawrence (west wall)	Fresco	1278-79	religious	Italian	1251-1300

39669-08thief.jpg	There is considerable disagreement about the attribution of this work to Titian. While the manner in which the colours are applied is reminiscent of his late work, the extraordinary spatial effect, which is mainly produced by the turning of the thief's cross, can be observed in none of his later works. The way the light falls would also be an unusual feature in Titian's works in the 1560s. If this indeed is not one of his paintings, it is nonetheless one of the highest quality examples of the adoption of elements of his style by other artists	TIZIANO Vecellio	Christ and the Good Thief	Oil on canvas, 137 x 149 cm	c. 1566	religious	Italian	1501-1550

35438-70religi.jpg	An extremely valuable work is housed in Santa Maria del Giglio: a Virgin and Child with the Infant St John by Rubens, the only painting by this artist in Venice. The central section on paper is by Rubens, and this is fixed onto canvas and connect- ed to a generic background comprising a tree and curtain hanging on the right, by a late seventeenth-century painter probably from the Veneto.Despite its critical vicissitudes over the centuries, there is no lack of elements substantiating the author of the painting and its very high quality: the brilliant quality of the afresh tones, especially in the children; the emotional intensity of the looks; the material richness and the expert technique evident in the several tones of Titian-style red on which the chromatic distribution of the entire fragment is based. Deep layers of solid and glazed lacquer are superimposed, often tone on tone and finely touched, from the clothes of the Virgin shaded in the grey filaments and earth green of the veil falling on her neck, to the profiles and extremely tender tips of the two children's fingers, heightened in white with the tip of the brush. Then there is the skillful painting of the Virgin's ear and of every other element in the work; the power of invention and of colour evident in the small patch of sky; the effect of shaping on form, seen in the facial features and breast of the Virgin, portrayed to great plastic effect, and partly the entire placement of the figures and overall composition, sensitive to the lessons of Caravaggio	RUBENS, Peter Paul	Virgin and Child with the Infant St John	Oil on paper fixed onto canvas	-	religious	Flemish	1601-1650
43912-banks.jpg	Sir Joseph Banks (1743-1820) was a naturalist and patron of science. From an early age, his declared passion was natural history, and in particular, botany. He joined Captain Cook's 1768 expedition on the Endeavour to Tahiti for astronomical observations (to observe the transit of Venus).In West's portrait he wears a Maori cloak and stands beside other trophies from New Zealand and Polynesia, as if in rebuke of his more conventional contemporaries who were portrayed in Rome with their purchases of classical antiquities	WEST, Benjamin	Joseph Banks	Oil on canvas, 234 x 160 cm	1773	portrait	American	1751-1800
20820-runningb.jpg	The painting depicts young nobleman, Marcus Pauli Holst von Schmidten, dashing off to school. The school in question was Christianis Institut, which focused greatly on movement and exercise. The school did pioneering work to give children the opportunity to play and do athletics in the open air. The school's playground was the first to be built in Denmark.The young nobleman is seen running on his way to school; his school is glimpsed in the background. The boy's figure is simultaneously in movement and in balance. It is one of few examples of a figure in movement in Juel's mature work. An engraving after the American painter Gilbert Stuart's The Skater (Washington, National Gallery of Art) may have served as inspiration for this painting	JUEL, Jens J?rgensen	A Running Boy	Oil on canvas, 181 x 126 cm	1802	genre	Danish	1751-1800
13165-christ_t.jpg	Cornelis Engebrechtsz. headed a large painters' workshop in the first decades of the 16th century, and trained Lucas van Leyden, Aertgen van Leyden and his own three sons, Pieter Cornelisz, Cornelis Cornelisz and Lucas Cornelisz. He and his pupils and assistants produced altarpieces and numerous smaller works for private devotion. One of his chief patrons was the Augustinian nunnery of Mari&#235;npoel just north of Leiden. Among the works he made for the convent church were altarpieces with the Lamentation (c. 1508) and the Crucifixion (c. 1517), which were described by Karel van Mander in 1604 and are now in Leiden's Museum de Lakenhal.The Amsterdam painting undoubtedly comes from an altarpiece illustrating episodes from the life of the Virgin. It was recognised as Engelbrechtsz.'s work in 1904, and shortly afterwards the Rijksmuseum was able to acquire a second, less well-preserved panel from the same altarpiece: Christ in the House of Martha and Mary.The events depicted in the two panels are not found in the Bible but in the popular late-medieval Meditationes vitae Christi. Both scenes precede the Arrest of Christ. In the conversation with his mother and Mary Magdalen, Christ refused to abandon his planned visit to Jerusalem during the Jewish Passover, and foretold his impending death.The second panel shows Christ taking leave of his mother, immediately before he and his disciples set off for Jerusalem. Movingly he embraces the kneeling Virgin amidst the sorrowful Marys and the apostles. Some of the disciples are descending into the valley on the right, with the city gate and walls of Jerusalem in the distance.The attribution of the panels to Engelbrechtsz., based partly on the correspondences in style, colouring and manner of execution with the Crucifixion triptych in Leiden, was recently confirmed by an examination of the two underdrawings using infrared reflectography. This painting is a fine example of the artist's more mature work. The poses and gestures in the figure group highlight the emotional nature of the leave-taking. The landscape and city in the background are painted in a surprisingly lively way. The steely, blue-white shapes of the mountains and rock formations contrast with the warm, bright colouring of the figures in the foreground. The attention paid to ornamental details, which was relatively slight by the standards of the day, and the broad manner of painting, which fades to the sketchy in the background, are typical of the work of Engelbrechtsz. and of the Leiden painters he trained	ENGEBRECHTSZ., Cornelis	Christ Taking Leave of his Mother	Oil on panel, 55 x 43 cm	c. 1515	religious	Netherlandish	1501-1550

Responsible for organizing the royal jousts so dear to Henri II, he was a skilled, subtle, and prudent courtier.

33346-musician.jpg	Régnier is documented in Rome from 1620. His paintings from his Roman period are markedly Caravaggesque in subject matter and style. The subject of music in painting had always been represented since the 16th century but it was in Rome, at the time of Caravaggio, that these scenes changed dramatically and that music per se became the central theme of pictures. Here the lute-player and singer each play and sing convincingly, and Régnier's accuracy in depicting both the instrument and the musical scores is impressive.

34655-louvre1.jpg	"French painting in the second half of the 18th century displays the overlapping or intermingling of pre-Romantic and Neoclassical pictorial ideas, and nowhere is this clearer than in the work of the 'painter of ruins', Hubert Robert. He obtained his ideas from Italy, where he admired the paintings of ruins by Giovanni Paolo Pannini, and witnessed the first excavations in Pompeii. Praised by Diderot, he was immediately consulted when antique pieces were to be placed in the park of Versailles. But his great work was the realization of the Louvre Museum. A comparison of two of his paintings, the first showing a ruined barrel-vault hall, and the second the Grande Galerie in the Louvre, immediately reveals the source of the idea for the top lighting and the ""antique effect"" that the newly designed gallery is open to the sky. The sublimity of antique ruins was to be transferred to the real building, and this in turn was to be a treasure chest of art and a worthy successor to its antique models"	ROBERT, Hubert	Imaginary View of the Grande Galerie in the Louvre in Ruins	Oil on canvas, 114,5 x 146 cm	1796	other	French	1751-1800

The fresco depicting a battle between mice and cats is part of an extensive ""Romanesque Bestiary""  whose images are distributed amongst numerous medieval churches and codices.

Finding the monastic life of his day in need of reform he founded communities that were vowed to solitude and silence, of which the best known was the monastery of Camaldoli in the Appenines near Arezzo. Romuald is old and white-bearded and is dressed in the habit of the Camaldolese Order, a striking loose-flowing white garment with wide sleeves. He holds a crutch.It was said that Romuald dreamed, like Jacob, of a ladder ascending to heaven and that the monks of his Order were going up it clad in white He is seated with his brethren under a tree, pointing to the vision in the background.

He has left no foreground space and every inch of Herod's hall is occupied by screaming mothers, dead or dying babies, and bloodthirsty soldiers. The marble pavement is covered by infant corpses.

17508-17virgin.jpg	This panel was probably the left half of a diptych, the right half with probably a praying donor has not survived. The most interesting feature of the painting is the Virgin's particularly contemplative mood and pose. The gesture of a figure with head in hand goes back to antiquity, and Renaissance examples featured Christ, Job, and St Jerome among others in this pose of contemplation. Gossart's painting was probably influenced by Dürer's St Jerome, or his Madonna of the Pear, which may have been in the Netherlands during Gossart's lifetime.The pastoral setting of the Virgin and Child is unique in Gossart's surviving work. Gossart apparently regularly employed landscape specialists to collaborate with him, the landscape in this panel was probably painted by such a specialist. The Master of the Female Half-Lengths, a close follower of Patenier, is the likely painter who added the landscape behind the figures	GOSSART, Jan	Virgin and Child in a Landscape	Oil on oak panel, 50 x 38 cm (without frame)	1531	religious	Flemish	1501-1550

The painting is signed and dated at the foot of the cross: ""Simone et Machilon pinserunt Hoc opus Anno Domini MCCLVII Domina Maria fieri Fecit"". Because it is one of the very few dated crosses from its period, this panel is an important reference point for the chronological reconstruction of thirteenth century central Italian workshop activity.Stylistically, the design follows the Giunta Pisano Crucifix in the church of San Domenico in Bologna, datable to around 1250 and the known prototype for a number of late thirteenth century crosses. This series has its finest expression in the Crucifix that Cimabue painted for Santa Croce in around 1287-88. Yet though they adhere strictly to the model of Giunta, especially in iconographic aspects, Simone and Machilone show some original characteristics, above all in the attenuation and hardness of line in the figure of Christ, less severe and more human in the National Gallery cross. Likewise, Simone and Machilone render anatomic details less schematically than their prototype. From Giunta, on the other hand, the artists inherit the languid abandon of the dead body of Christ, which they interpret with perfect mastery. Also masterfully rendered is the complex Hebraic drapery wrapped around the body, different from the brown drapery of Giunta's Christ, which provided the prototype for another Cross, attributed to Coppo di Marcovaldo, in the Pinacoteca of San Gimignano."

30009-lottery.jpg	Isaak Ouwater was the best follower of Jan van der Heyden. He concentrated on cityscapes. Although Ouwater's paintings can be a little dry and airless, and, when compared to to van der Heyden's, appear timid, he always displays a fine sense of design as is evident in his Lottery Office.Here his debt to van der Heyden's execution also is unmistakable; in it his minute handling is best enjoyed with a magnifying glass. But his close, frontal view of the street scene is original. The painting is an exact rendering of the façades of three houses in the Kalverstraat in Amsterdam which have an antiquarian interest that enhances the painting's historical value. The lottery office that the crowd is trying to enter was first inhabited by Clement de Jonghe, who posed for Rembrandt and was a publisher of Rembrandt's etchings. The house on the right was once occupied by Jacob van Ruisdael, the one on the left by Aert van der Neer	OUWATER, Isaak	The Lottery Office	Oil on canvas	1779	other	Dutch	1751-1800
06394-20dulle.jpg	This painting was mentioned by Carel van Mander in 1604 in his 'Schilderboeck'. He described the principal character of the painting as 'a Mad Meg pillaging at the mouth of Hell / seemingly perplexed / and cruelly and strangely attired', an evil and fearsome woman or witch. Van Mander remained vague about the actual significance of the painting. Perhaps it had already been forgotten by his time. We can be certain, however, that Bruegel gave the work a hidden allegorical or religious meaning, albeit one that remains a mystery. A great many experts have devoted their energies to solving the problem, but none has ever succeeded entirely in explaining the painting. Most of them focus on the possible symbolism of the large woman in the foreground, with her suit of armor, sword, cutlery and money-box. She has been variously interpreted as a symbol of heresy or violence, the personification of hum,an evil and an allegory of instability.Recently it was proposed that Meg symbolizes Madness, a vice taken in the 16th century to include insanity, rage, gluttony, lust, avarice and ambition, and that the giant figure in the centre of the painting is an allegory of Folly. The additional scenes surrounding the two figures illustrate the causes and repercussions of these two human failings. It was concluded that Bruegel's allegory was intended as an attack on both human nature and the political and religious situation in 16th-century Antwerp.We could fill a book with suggested interpretations of Mad Meg and it is highly doubtful whether it would bring the viewer any closer to the true meaning of the painting. Nevertheless, the work never fails to fascinate, even without specialist knowledge. No one can fail to appreciate its apocalyptic vision. For that reason, it has also been plausibly interpreted as the Breaking of the Seventh Seal, as recounted in the Book of Revelations. Mad Meg is, indeed, reminiscent of the book of the Apocalypse	BRUEGEL, Pieter the Elder	Dulle Griet (Mad Meg)	Oil on wood, 117,4 x 162 cm	c. 1562	other	Netherlandish	1501-1550
12470-soldiers.jpg	During the second quarter of the 17th century a group of artists began to specialize in painting the life of soldiers. Scenes of plunder and battle were depicted but the ancient battle of sexes, where the field of action was a room in an inn or a barrack, and in which the outcome of the struggle is not much in doubt, was more frequently represented. Other popular subjects were soldiers drinking, smoking and gambling at cards or tric-trac, activities that contemporary predicants and moralists condemned as vices that endanger salvation. But it is doubtful if the painters of these scenes and their clients viewed them as pictorial reminders of the perils of sin and the inexorable need to lead a virtuous life. Pictures of the life of off-duty soldiers were called by the Dutch 'cortegaardjes' a corruption of the French term 'corps de garde'. The better ones show little movement or overt action. Painters of them had a special feeling for tonal values and their pictures take on a certain still-life quality. In their half-dark interiors the light glitters over uniforms, and a fine subdued play of colours, mostly broken and harmonized by delicate half-tones, betrays the Dutch gift for intimate pictorial qualities and a subtle rendering of textures. Some even anticipate the achievement of the high society painters of the following generation, when well-to-do burghers rather than soldiers and their friends became the favoured subject of genre painters. Specialists in this category worked in Amsterdam, Utrecht, Delft, but seldom in Haarlem. The leading ones in Amsterdam were Willem Duyster and Pieter Codde.What sets Duyster's rare pictures apart from those made by his contemporaries is his distinct chiaroscuro and the refinement of his colours. He was also better able than any of them to convey the fascinating visual drama which can take place  when people do little more than confront each other. It is difficult to think of a painter of his time who surpasses his penetrating characterization of the personalities of the men gathered round a fireplace in the modest nocturnal scene in the Soldiers beside a Fireplace in the Philadelphia museum. (Versions are also in the Hermitage, and in Düsseldorf.)  Duyster's approach is always original. His cortegaardjes and small pictures of dignified full-length single figures seen against dark backgrounds served as one of the points of departure for Terborch's great accomplishment in these branch of painting	DUYSTER, Willem Cornelisz.

42241-0309vela.jpg	Philip IV was a bold and enthusiastic huntsman, it was usual for the king to ride out with a small retinue in the extensive game preserves of the densely wooded Pardo. Emperor Charles V had built a watchtower on the way to the mountainous hunting grounds of the Sierra, as a place to stop and rest before the most strenuous stage of the journey. This tower was known as the Torre de la Parada, and Philip, who was particularly fond of it, extended it to make a comfortable hunting lodge. He was in haste to see it furnished, and commissioned Rubens to provide a large collection of new pictures on mythological subjects.After 1638, when the building itself was completed, it was the task of Velázquez to decide how they should be hung, and to contribute a series of hunting portraits himself, to hang with other appropriate works already in existence and with pictures by Dutch masters. This project cost him a great deal of time and trouble, but it also won him increasing appreciation at court.Velázquez's three extant hunting portraits (Philip IV as a Hunter, Prince Baltasar Carlos as a Hunter, and Cardinal Infante Don Fernando as a Hunter) are life-size. Don Fernando, the king's younger brother, despite his spiritual calling, did not hesitate to indulge his passion for hunting. In this painting, showing him with his gun at the ready, he looks even more of a huntsman than his relations. His expressive outline balances the silhouette of the cinnamon-coloured dog sitting in front of him, a figure once again illustrating the court painter's skill in depicting animals. He pays them as much careful attention as he expends on human beings; while he is of course aware of the differences between animals and humans, he is also conscious of the dignity shared by all living creatures. The natural elegance of a horse's head or the body of a dog, their fiery or faithful natures - few painters have captured the beauty and individuality of animals as unforgettably as Velázquez	VELÁZQUEZ, Diego Rodriguez de Silva y	Cardinal Infante Don Fernando as a Hunter	Oil on canvas, 192 x 108 cm	1632-33	portrait	Spanish	1601-1650

15601-12sasset.jpg	The painting, in which the head of the man and the hands of the figures are entirely overpainted, depicts Francesco Sassetti (1421-1490), general manager of the Medici bank, and (probably) his younger son Teodoro.

However, the ruined condition of the present painting precludes comparison with the datable likenesses of Sassetti	GHIRLANDAIO, Domenico	Francesco Sassetti and His Son Teodoro II	Tempera on wood, 76 x 53 cm	c. 1490	portrait	Italian	1451-1500
00656-lastsup.jpg	The Cenacolo of San Salvi is possibly the one which most easily lends itself to the transformation into a museum, with its fairly large interiors on the ground and first floors. It was part of a Vallombrosan convent and it passed to the Ladies of Faenza. In 1511 a contract was drawn up with Andrea del Sarto for the decoration of the Refectory. Although commissioned at the beginning of his career, it was carried out slowly and was completed between 1520-25, a particularly fine period of the work of Andrea del Sarto.Miraculously spared during the Siege of Florence in 1529-30, the fresco is placed under a large arch containing painted medallions with the Trinity and four Saints, protectors of the Vallombrosan Order. Andrea's personality and background are evident in the fresco's innovations; he appears to be influenced by Leonardo and the Roman work of Michelangelo and Raphael, revealed in a work of magnificence and pre-baroque spontaneity	ANDREA DEL SARTO	The Last Supper	Fresco, 525 x 871 cm	1520-25	religious	Italian	1501-1550

However, the iconography of Luttichuijs's paintings, with their emphasis on mortality, the images seem merely to refer old age as such, not to specific individuals	LUTTICHUIJS, Simon	Still Life with a Skull	Oil on canvas	1635-40	still-life	Dutch	1601-1650
03483-jerome1.jpg	In the second half of the fourteenth century, Augustinian nuns erected a church in the district of Cannareggio in Venice and dedicated the sacristy and a confraternity to St Jerome. They ambitiously decorated their headquarter with paintings depicting episodes from the life of the titular saint. Bastiani's contribution to the cycle consisted of two huge canvases, the Communion of St Jerome, and the Funeral of St Jerome.In the Communion of St Jerome, the saint is kneeling in his cell, as is confirmed by his bed, the open book, the crucifix, and the scourge. He is supported by his friend and disciple Eusebius and surrounded by the brethren. A pillar defines another scene. In the cloister of the monastery in Jerusalem, Jerome faces a person in eastern attire while he walks in the garden with another individual dressed in the Greek style, which may allude to his battle against heresy. The huge tree in the foreground is a symbol of salvation and life, while in the background, the hills, the battlements, and the well, although drawn from real life, are Marian symbols designed to inspire the devout to meditation and silent prayer. On the right, the quail represent the church, and the lion, the usual attribute of the saint, also belongs to St Mark and thus to the Venetian Republic	BASTIANI, Lazzaro	Communion of St Jerome	Oil on canvas, 191 x 240 cm	1470-72	religious	Italian	1451-1500
24098-6victory.jpg	The Madonna of Victory was commissioned by Francesco II Gonzaga To celebrate his victory over the French at Fornovo on 6 July 1495. On the first anniversary of the battle the altarpiece was installed with great ceremony over the high altar in the chapel of Santa Maria della Vittoria in Mantua.By the end of the 15th century, large single paintings  were being used as altarpieces, a form that reached its apogee in the works of Titian and Veronese. The stiffly hierarchical composition of the traditional Sacra Conversazione was also discarded.Mantegna's Mary is turning slightly away from the central axis, which runs from the Tree of Knowledge on the throne pedestal up through the Christ Child to the branch of coral hanging on a chain.

08586-5portra3.jpg	In 1902, Cézanne bought a plot of land on the Chemin des Lauves, on an otherwise undeveloped hillside to the north of Aix, and had a two-storey house built with a large studio, some five metres high, on the first floor. He used the studio early in the morning and in the late afternoon. When it became too hot, he would paint watercolours on the terrace, which was surrounded by bushes and small trees and had a magnificent view of the town of Aix.

44042-3john.jpg	The right panel depicts the Beheading of St John the Baptist.As a lascivious worldly beauty, Salome wears a magnificent dress in the fashion of French princesses, with exotic decorative items including the pointed head-dress. The background shows the scene of the banquet in which Salome's mother, Herodias, stabs the decapitated head of the Baptist in her hatred for him.The shallow zone of the foreground is set off by the strong effects of depth in the side panels, where the rooms are almost like tunnels. This makes the narrative backgrounds of the left and right panels subordinate. In the beheading of the Baptist, the body of the executed man is part of the foreground group, and the executioner can set his sword against John's right shoulder, shown in a flat plane. At the same time, however, two mourners who belong to the background are placed directly above the cellar stairs where the dead man is lying, and a figure diminished to about one-third of the size of the foreground figures appears to be standing only a little farther back from them.The side panels of the St John Altarpiece do not merely show the beginning and end of the Baptist's earthly life. The parallels between the pictorial motifs also express moral conflict. On the right, the unchaste Salome, in magnificent and seductive clothing, holds the Baptist's head. She and the executioner are turning away from each other and from their victim, as if painfully conscious of the crime that has been committed.Interestingly, however, the figure of Salome looks like a variant on the Virgin Mary in the Annunciation scene of the St. Columba Altarpiece (Alte Pinakothek, Munich), where the figure's knees are placed apart in an even more balletic position. Rogier was obviously able to make effective use of this elaborate and artificial pose in various circumstances, and only the worldly magnificence of Salome's dress and the context cause the viewer to assess it differently here. In addition, Salome's grave and melancholy face does not in fact differ much from the face of the Virgin Mary in that Annunciation, although in this later version it is leaning at rather too pronounced an angle to express grace. The artist has not set out simply to make the figure of Salome merely despicable; indeed, in the context of this scene, her noble features give her a touch of complex ambivalence	WEYDEN, Rogier van der	St John Altarpiece (right panel)	Oil on oak panel, 77 x 48 cm	1455-60	religious	Flemish	1401-1450

04903-venus_ad.jpg	The story of Venus and Adonis is taken from the tenth book of Ovid's Metamorphoses. Venus, the goddess of love, becomes enamoured of the beautiful young huntsman, Adonis. In Bol's painting Venus and the young Cupid try in vain to prevent Adonis from going hunting, as the goddess has had a premonition that the hunting party will have fatal consequences, and indeed the hunter is killed by a wild boar.The story of Venus and Adonis was a favourite in the Netherlands. Rubens painted the subject several times and Bol later painted another picture of the same theme. It was probably the moral component that made the story popular: Adonis was seen as the epitome of reckless youth, whose rejection of Venus' advice led him to his death	BOL, Ferdinand	Venus and Adonis	Oil on canvas, 168 x 230 cm	c. 1658	mythological	Dutch	1651-1700

22606-9medici.jpg	"This painting was commissioned by Cosimo de' Medici. It is still in the Palazzo Medici Riccardi in Florence.Orphaned at a young age, Filippo Lippi was raised in the Carmelite convent of Santa Maria in Florence, where he would undoubtedly have seen Masaccio and Masolino at work on the frescoes in the Brancacci chapel. He took vows himself, but proved to be wholly unsuited to religious life. His name surfaces often in court documents. Tried for embezzlement (even tortured on the rack), he lived openly with a Carmelite nun, Lucretia Buti, who was his model and with whom he had a son -- painter Filippino  Lippi. His patron Cosimo de' Medici sheltered Filippo in ""protective custody"" at the Medici palace, hoping to prod him into finishing tardy commissions, but the artist escaped. He was eventually allowed to leave his order and marry Lucretia, but continued to wear a monk's habit and sign his works Fra (""brother"") Filippo.Filippo's Virgin is wistful and slightly melancholy, while the infant's heavy, almost muscular form recalls Masaccio's emphatically three-dimensional figures. Masaccio had used strongly directional light to reveal the form of his figures. Filippo's Virgin and child, on the other hand, are bathed in an overall glow that prevents the modeling of the figures from overpowering the graceful and well-defined line of his composition.

35817-after_ra.jpg	Several members of the Ruysdael family of Haarlem figure in the history of Dutch painting, particularly landscape painting, the earliest of them, Salomon van Ruysdael, being inscribed in the Haarlem painters' guild in 1623. After the Rain, the earliest of the nine paintings by him in Budapest, contains a motif often repeated in his later paintings: a sandy road leading to a building half hidden by trees. Here and there we see breaks in the clouds which otherwise cover the sky, the air is still moist and misty after the storm, and the freshened foliage and the damp sand convey to perfection the characteristic atmosphere of the coastal countryside. In his early works, such as this, Salomon van Ruysdael used vivid greenish and yellowish colours, and it was only later that his colouring became darker and more muted.This painting is one of Ruysdael's finest early dune landscapes.

Archangel Raphael, sent by God to help Tobit and his family, asked Tobit (who did not recognize the angel) whether he may escort his son on his journey and, in company with Tobias' faithful hound, they departed together. They reached the Tigris, where Tobias was attacked by a gigantic fish. The archangel ordered him to capture it and had him remove and conserve its gall, heart and liver. The innards proved to be a medicine which he can use to restore his father's sight	ASSERETO, Gioachino	Tobias Healing the Blindness of His Father	Oil on canvas, 147 x 203 cm	-	religious	Italian	1601-1650
03374-praying.jpg	Marco Basaiti, an admirer of Antonello da Messina and Giovanni Bellini found himself fascinated at the beginning of the sixteenth century by the new artistic manner pioneered by Giorgione. Already in 'Christ Praying in the Garden' which adorned the first altar on the right in the Church of San Giobbe and which belonged to the family of Francesco Foscari, the influence of the style of Antonello (visible in the integrity of colour of the figures and the arrangement of saints at the sides of the portico, of the apostles, and of Christ absorbed in prayer) gives way in the landscape to lyrically dreaming passages clearly drawing their spirit from Giorgione. Though this panel may not exactly offer a complete synthesis of the late fifteenth century world with the dazzling innovations of the early years of the sixteenth century, it is nevertheless emblematic of the meeting-point of two of the finest ages of Venetian painting.The doubt over the date derive from a faded inscription. The represented saints are Louis of Toulouse, Francis, Dominic, and Mark	BASAITI, Marco	Christ Praying in the Garden	Panel, 371 x 224 cm	1510 or 1516	religious	Italian	1501-1550
16056-legend.jpg	The decoration of the Upper Church was planned from the very beginning to conclude with the Legend of St Francis on the lower walls.The St. Francis cycle is usually dated after 1296 (Vasari records that the cycle was commissioned by Giovanni da Murro, who only became General of the Franciscans in 1296). However, according to some experts, the cycle was painted earlier.Scenes of the cycle:1. Homage of a Simple Man2. St Francis Giving his Mantle to a Poor Man3. Dream of the Palace4. Miracle of the Crucifix5. Renunciation of Wordly Goods6. Dream of Innocent III7. Confirmation of the Rule8. Vision of the Flaming Chariot9. Vision of the Thrones10.

13772-mary_mag.jpg	The image of this famous repentant sinner, prototype of the penitent in Christian art, became one of the favourite subjects of European art in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.In a career that spanned only thirteen years, Fetti's work underwent an astonishing evolution, from objective realism to lyricism, from compact form to the erosion of space, from solid and plastic modeling to a broken and agitated kind of painting, from descriptive to tortuous brush strokes, from dry to oily and liquid tints, from local colour to tonality, and from analytical concreteness to a sweetly sentimental air. Here the artist takes his inspiration from Correggio's Mary Magdalene reading. He represents the sensual and seductive heroine with half-closed eyes, lowered head, and the characteristic gesture of the hand on which she rests her head, with an intensely melancholic significance, equivalent to 'tristitia'. In fact the painter conceived this theme in terms of a Meditation or Melancholy.It is worth remembering that Giovan Battista Andreini's drama Maddalena was published in Mantua in 1617, and may have provided the idea for the painting. In any case, the last possible date for its execution is 1621, the date on which a copy (now at Hampton Court), possibly the work of the painter's sister Lucrina Fetti, was delivered to Ferdinando Gonzaga	FETTI, Domenico	The Repentant St Mary Magdalene	Oil on canvas, 98 x 78,5 cm	1617-21	religious	Italian	1601-1650
05464-40pomegr.jpg	The picture's title is explained by the pomegranate in Mary's hand: this should be understood as symbolizing Christ's Passion, the wealth of seeds conveying the fullness of Christ's suffering. A comparison of this painting with Botticelli's earlier tondo Madonna del Magnificat reveals that the artist has now arranged the angels symmetrically, thereby avoiding the compositional difficulties of the older depiction.The Christ Child, whose hand is raised in blessing, is lying securely in the arms of Mary, but the sad, melancholy expression on the faces of mother and child are intended to remind the observer of the torments the Son of God will suffer in the future. The angels are worshipping Mary with lilies and garlands of roses. The Rosary is a prayer that was created in its present form in the 15th century, and rapidly became widespread. The beginning of this prayer is embroidered on the left angel s stola: AVE GRAZIA PLENA (Hail Mary, full of grace)	BOTTICELLI, Sandro	Madonna of the Pomegranate (Madonna della Melagrana)	Tempera on panel, diameter 143,5 cm	c. 1487	religious	Italian	1451-1500

39704-06bravo.jpg	In the 17th century the painting was attributed to Giorgione, and later for a long time to Palma Vecchio. However, recently it was given to Tiziano.The Bravo, so called because of the mysterious armed man with his back to us, falls into Titian's Giorgionesque phase and demonstrates an undercurrent of cruelty. The subject has been convincingly identified as the arrest of Bacchus by Pentheus, King of Thebes, who opposed the Bacchic cult.

35147-lastsup.jpg	"The fresco is from the cycle of the life of Christ in the Sistine Chapel, it is located in the sixth compartment on the north wall. This scene is not so eventful as the other frescoes of the cycle, but the highlighted chalice standing on the table in front of Christ emphasizes the fact that we are seeing the institution of the sacrament of the Eucharist and, accordingly, a symbol of the New Covenant between God and mankind.

42817-4cather1.jpg	In this work, originally the altar-screen of the church of St Catherine, Veronesian colour reaches a peak of richness and splendour. Along the diagonal of the composition which terminates in the drapes billowing around the columns, new chromatic notes are struck; the 'fortissimo' of the steps and figures in the foreground harmonizes with the 'pianissimo' of angels and cherubs which emerge from the grey-gold clouds of the celestial kingdom in the background. Linking the two planes of colour are two cherubs holding the martyr's palm and the heavenly crown above the Virgin and St Catherine while the angel below lifts her head and holds out her arms to receive the sign and the reward of martyrdom. All three are portrayed with Apollonian purity against the intense blue of the sky, an unforgettable example of Veronese's exquisite use of colour. Even more appropriate is the 17th century comment by Marco Boschini: 'It is almost as if the painter to create his effects used gold, pearls and rubies, emeralds sapphires and purest, most perfect diamonds'.Here too, as in his pictures of religious feasts, Veronese successfully combines the religious subject with social pomp and ceremony, transforming the sacred event into a luxurious sixteenth-century festival. He achieves this in part by changing the setting of the episode, which no longer takes place in Alexandria but in a typically Venetian location	VERONESE, Paolo	Mystical Marriage of St Catherine	Oil on canvas, 337 x 241 cm	c. 1575	religious	Italian	1551-1600
18710-1ospeda2.jpg	"The decoration of the Music Room is divided into two parts, one dedicated to the world of allegories, the other to the real world. Apollo, the god of music, dominates the fresco on the back wall of the Room, which is splendidly laid out by Agostino Mengozzi Colonna in a manner that recalls the scheme employed by the elder Mengozzi Colonna to frame Tiepolo's The Banquet of Cleopatra in the Palazzo Labia. Apollo personally directs the orchestra of young girls (the ""putte"") seated in his right. Next to him, dressed in yellow, Pasquale Anfossi (1727-1797), the opera composer who was then in charge of the Ospedaletto, conducts the chorus, holding a rolled-up musical score"	GUARANA, Jacopo	Apollo Conducting the Orchestra of Putte	Fresco	1776	mythological	Italian	1751-1800

33574-103portr.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 391.The sitter's name and age are inscribed on the canvas in a later hand, 'Catrina Hooghsaet/Out 50 Jaer' (ie. 50 years old). Catharina (Catrina) Hooghsaet (1607-1685) was the wife of a dyer, Hendrick Jacobsz. Rooleeuw, and Rembrandt may have painted his portrait too, although, if so, all trace of it has been lost. The couple were Mennonites, a flourishing Protestant sect to which Rembrandt also intermittently belonged. Among the restrictions the Mennonites, followers of the sixteenth-century Dutch divine, Menno Simons, imposed on themselves were a refusal to bear arms or hold public office. The sect was popular with artists and craftsmen, as by joining it they were able to escape the control exercised by the clergy over the lives of orthodox Calvinist citizens.To judge from Catrina's clothes, which are relatively plain but of good quality, her husband was successful in his business. (The bleaching and dyeing of cloth were important Dutch industries.) The pair probably did not belong to the highest social class but Catrina acts almost as if she did. She sits confidently in her chair in a way that is both relaxed and animated, and a quizzical smile plays over her features. The handkerchief she holds in her hand supplies a touch of informality, as does the parrot perched on a ring hanging from the ceiling. Altogether this is a wonderful portrait, vigorous, crisp and surprisingly clear in lighting for its date	REMBRANDT Harmenszoon van Rijn	Portrait of Catharina Hooghsaet	Oil on canvas, 126 x 98 cm	1657	portrait	Dutch	1601-1650
21934-8jerome.jpg	In about 370, St Jerome, later a Father of the Church, is said to have withdrawn to live as a hermit in the desert of Chalcis near Antioch, in order to produce a translation of the Bible and live as an ascetic. Leonardo depicts the Father of the Church as a penitent, not a scholar. St Jerome is kneeling in a humble posture that arouses our sympathy, in front of the sketched cross of Christ on the right, and before him lies the lion, his attribute. In his right hand he is holding a stone with which he is striking his breast.

41183-zhairy2.jpg	"Three small paintings in the collection of Archduke Ferdinand II of Tirol portray Pedro Gonzalez and his two oldest children. The ""hairy man from Munich"", as he is called, is considered the first documented case of the so-called ""Ambras Syndrome"", a congenital illness, which results in the growth of hair on the face as well as the entire body after birth. The fate of the hair-covered members of the Gonzalez family is noted for its reputation as a natural wonder. They were considered animals, who were both marvelled at and presented as gifts. Father and son, at least, turned their condition to a certain prestige and material advantage.Born around 1537 on the Canary Island, the hispanized and baptized Pedro was presented in his infancy as a gift to the French King, Henry II. The king arranged his marriage to Catherine who did not suffer from the syndrome.

10263-02cuspi1.jpg	Johannes Spiessheimer (Cuspinian) was a scholar in the court of the Emperor Maximilian I, himself a writer, who made Vienna, through its chancellery and university, the leading humanist city in Germany. Cranach painted the double portrait of the Viennese humanist Dr. Cuspinian and his wife Anna, daughter of an official of the Emperor on the occasion of their marriage. Cranach composed these portraits as a pair. This is apparent in the continuity of the landscape behind the elegantly dressed couple. The trees at the edges of the painting, on the left and right of the figures, are placed so that their branches form an arch, imparting an air of grandeur to the sitters.The background was evidently composed with a distinct purpose in mind: nothing here is arbitrary. The landscape is full of erudite symbolism, probably devised by Cuspinian himself. The various images disguise hieroglyphic allusions to the cabbala. However, it would be quite unsatisfactory merely to decipher the landscape background symbol by symbol without seeing its significance as a whole. Beyond a system of occult signs, the landscape allows a generous framework for the couple's understanding of themselves, providing a medium for the new cult of sensitivity and awareness of nature which some humanists were propagating in literary form through the Classical topos of the pleasance, or pleasure-park	CRANACH, Lucas the Elder	Portrait of Dr. Johannes Cuspinian	Oil on wood, 59 x 45 cm	c. 1502	portrait	German	1501-1550
14696-01conver.jpg	This charming picture belongs to Gainsborough's early period, when he was working in London and Suffolk. The theme of the conversation in a park evokes Watteau and his school; it denotes a French influence, which played a considerable part in the formation of the artist - he was in fact a pupil of the French engraver Gravelot at the St Martins Lane Academy. This picture has been thought to represent Thomas Sandby and his wife. At the Watson sale in 1832, it was described as depicting the artist and his wife. The painter's marriage took place in 1746; a very similar work, Mr and Mrs Andrews, is dated 1748.The open-air portrait is a familiar theme in the English school, whereas in eighteenth-century France the portrait is usually in an interior. The evocation of nature by the English portrait painters is on the whole conventional; it is quite another matter with Gainsborough, however, who has treated the landscape for its own sake	GAINSBOROUGH, Thomas	Conversation in a Park	Oil on canvas, 73 x 68 cm	c. 1740	genre	English	1751-1800

11111-early02.jpg	Beside portraiture, Degas's early work was also centred on historical themes drawn from religious tradition or mythology.

They conformed to the rules of classicist composition, but they were also  innovative because of the freshness of his figures and the warm colours of his landscapes.The Young Spartans Exercising was reworked several times, and numerous related drawings and studies survive	DEGAS, Edgar	Young Spartans Exercising	Oil on canvas, 109 x 155 cm	c. 1860	historical	French	1851-1900

23942-miracl6.jpg	The Confraternity of the Scuola Grande di San Giovanni Evangelista in Venice called upon the most respected Venetian painters of the period, including  Pietro Perugino, Vittore Carpaccio, Gentile Bellini, Giovanni Mansueti, Lazzaro Bastiani and Benedetto Diana to paint nine canvases for the Great Hall of their headquarters showing the Miracles of the Holy Cross, the story of the miracles performed by the fragment of wood from the Cross on which Jesus was crucified. This fragment had been donated to the brotherhood in 1369 by Philip de Mezières, Chancellor of the Kingdom of Cyprus and Jerusalem, and had soon become an object of great veneration and the symbol of the Scuola, one of the most important and wealthy Venetian confraternities.The canvas painted by Perugino has been lost, but the eight surviving paintings executed between 1496 and 1501, contain depictions of some of the most famous parts of Venice. Since the imposing series of pictures (known as 'teleri') are all in the Accademia now it is easy to compare them.The subject of this 'telero' is the miraculous healing in 1414 of the little daughter of Benvegnudo. Having been paralysed ever since birth, she gained the use of her limbs after touching the three candles which her father had placed on the relic of the Holy Cross.

28888-grassi1.jpg	"The Palazzo Grassi, overlooking the Grand Canal opposite the Ca' Rezzonico in Venice. was built for the Grassi family by Giorgio Massari between 1749 and 1766. The architect adopted an innovative solution on the ground floor, with its two-story high main hall, large colonnaded courtyard, and ""imperial style' main staircase, which proceed with grand theatrical effect from the Grand Canal façade through to the back of the building.For the decoration of the first staircase landing, Massari turned to his trusted sculptor, Giovan Maria Morlaiter, who is responsible for the large bas-relief that depicts Concord. It was the celebrated sculptor, who suggested his own son, Michelangelo, to execute the frescoes on the second landing. The architecture was painted by Francesco Zanchi (active 1734-1772).Morlaiter's decoration develops along the walls of the staircase space, at the level of the second landing. Inside seven large arches delimited by Ionic pilasters, he painted a large faux loggia, closed off at the back by a marble wall, against which statues of goddesses stand inside aedicules surmounted by rectangular tympanums. A carnival-like reception is under way on the loggia, and the participants include a number of elegant ladies and noblemen, some in wigs, some in three-cornered hats, as well as a prelate and an Eastern figure, all busy conversing amiably, or sipping coffee and liquors served by efficient waiters in livery.In spite of the fact that Morlaiter's authorship is well documented, in the nineteenth century the frescoes were attributed to several painters, among them Pietro Longhi"	MORLAITER, Michelangelo	Decoration of the grand staircase	Fresco	c. 1766	interior	Italian	1751-1800
10706-cloud_sx.jpg	"After working as a decorative painter in his home town of Bergen, Norway, Dahl studied landscape painting at the Copenhagen Academy from 1811 to 1818. Here he was impressed by the work of Jens Juel and Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg, but the crucial influence came with a study of the seventeenth-century Dutch masters of landscape. One of them, Allaert Everdingen, had visited Norway and subsequently developed a type of ""Nordic landscape"" based on his impressions. This style was later taken up by the Norwegian national movement in the nineteenth century. Alongside the ""Italian landscape,"" the ""Nordic landscape"" also became established on the Continent early in the century.Stimulated by his first extensive travels through Norway in 1826, Dahl supplemented his previous range of motifs - waterfalls, moving clouds, and windswept trees - with depictions of the bare plateaus of the high mountain regions and their cloud formations, becoming an innovator in Norwegian as well as German landscape painting. In 1818, he settled at Dresden, where he associated with Caspar David Friedrich and Carl Gustav Carus. In 1824, like Friedrich, he was appointed professor at the Dresden Academy.

37306-foglian1.jpg	"The fresco of Guidoriccio da Fogliano, depicting the conquest of the castles of Montemassi and Sassoforte in 1328, formed part of a fresco cycle ""Castelli"" which occupied the upper part of the wall opposite to the Maest&#224; in the Sala del Mappamondo. The cycle, commemorating the castles conquered by the Sienese, was initiated in 1314 by the representation of the Castle of Giuncarico, it was continued by the Guidoriccio and in 1331 by the Castles of Arcidosso and Piano. The latter were destroyed in 1361 when Lippo Vanni painted the Battles of Valdichiana and Poggio Imperiale. In the 1970s, the famous fresco, which had always been, considered the greatest example of Martini's artistic excellence, was re-attributed to a much later artist. The controversy that followed this re-attribution, further stimulated by the discovery of a fresco below the Guidoriccio (a very beautiful one, and certainly much older as we can see from the overlapping of the intonaco), turned into an animated diatribe that has not yet been placated"	SIMONE MARTINI	Equestrian Portrait of Guidoriccio da Fogliano	Fresco	c. 1330	portrait	Italian	1301-1350

42536-ruthnaom.jpg	The biblical story depicted here is the following. Ruth was a Moabite woman and great-grandmother of David. The very human and sympathetic study of her in the book of Ruth relates how she was married to a Hebrew immigrant in Moab and after his death left her native land and went with her mother-in-law Naomi, to Bethlehem. Here she was allowed to glean the corn in the fields belonging to Boaz, a rich farmer and kinsman of Naomi. Ruth, true to her nature, maintained, on Naomi's advice, a modest demeanour among the young men working at the harvest. One night she went and lay at the feet of Boaz as he slept in the field. By this act Boaz saw her virtue and later decided to assume the responsibilities toward her of a kinsman.

These aspects are already evident in the present work, in which as much attention is devoted to the tablets bearing the Ten Commandments as to the prophet.

Formerly, in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, it was sold for the Acquisitions Fund in 2013.The soft modeling of the figures in this panel is typical of Bicci's style. The painting is in very good condition and allows us to appreciate the care taken to describe the delicate folds of the red mantle, the gold highlights at the edges of the robes, the raised inscriptions in the halos and the fine decoration of both the damask cloth on the floor and the sheet that wraps the Christ Child. This interest in the intricate adornment of the fabrics, in particular, points to Gentile's influence on Bicci	BICCI DI LORENZO	Madonna and Child with Saints Matthew and Francis	Tempera on panel, 83 x 48 cm	1430s	religious	Italian	1401-1450
23740-andorfe2.jpg	The sitter of the portrait is Sebastian Andorfer (1469-1537), a top mining official of Schwaz in Tirol. His father held a prominent position in the mining administration at Schwaz, serving as 'Silberbrenner' (refiner of silver) from 1470 to 1499. Sebastian assumed the post in 1499 and occupied it until his death in 1537.A variant of the portrait exists, also dated 1517, in which Andorfer is depicted bearded. The two portraits may exemplify the practice, which can be observed in contemporary medals, of recording a change in appearance for eternity. However, no known biographical events correspond with the 1517 date of the portraits. Furthermore, technical investigations suggest that the execution of the beardless portrait preceded the bearded one.The two Andorfer portraits stand as the earliest securely dated works in Maler's oeuvre	MALER, Hans	Sebastian Andorfer	Oil on panel, 43 x 36 cm	1517	portrait	German	1501-1550
33423-66newtes.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 615.In 1661, Rembrandt painted a small group of half-length figures of apostles, each with a strongly individualized character. At present only four seem to be definitely from his hand, though others have been attributed to him. One of the four is this St Bartholomew and another, slightly distinct from the rest because Rembrandt used himself as the model, is St Paul.St Bartholomew holds his traditional attribute, the knife with which he was flayed to death. It is, of course, no more than a formal means of identifying him and as such was a common device in art. Apart from the knife, there is nothing in Rembrandt's painting to indicate that the figure is a saint; not even his clothes are obviously antique, and he grasps the knife as if he were about to cut something with it. Moreover, there is the curious accident that his short hair, parted almost in the middle, and his wide moustache give him the look of a man of the late nineteenth century	REMBRANDT Harmenszoon van Rijn	St Bartholomew	Oil on canvas, 88 x 75 cm	1661	religious	Dutch	1601-1650

40766-09icon.jpg	Every day of the Church year is dedicated to the memory of one or more saints or to a feast which commemorates an important event in the life of Christ or His mother. While it is fairly common to find depictions of all the saints and feasts commemorated in a particular month, it is rare to see the whole Church year painted on one or two panels. The picture shows an old Russian example of a complete calendar in the form of a diptych.The Orthodox liturgical year comprises two cycles of festivals: one of movable feasts based on the lunar calendar, and another, whose dates are fixed, based on the solar year. The saints and feasts of the latter are depicted in ten rows on each panel, in precise chronological order.

10951-trompe.jpg	The work of Gerard David, another foreigner drawn to the wealthy city of Bruges, offers a final summary of the technical and spiritual tradition of the fifteenth century. David was born in Oudewater in Holland, but worked mostly in Bruges between 1484 and 1523, where, in a manner of speaking, he became Memling's successor. Two of his masterpieces, The Judgment of Cambyses (1498) and the Triptych of Jan des Trompes, belong to the Groeninge Museum in Bruges. In both works, Memling's flawless precision and cool smoothness are combined with the anatomical realism and seriousness of Van der Goes.The triptych with the Baptism of Christ, even though it was probably done after the Judgment of Cambyses, still breathes the quiet, ethereal atmosphere so characteristic of the Flemish Primitives. It is also one of the period's most remarkable artistic evocations of landscape and flora. It was commissioned by Jan des Trompes, a leading civil servant in Bruges, who appears in the painting with his first and second wives (front and rear of the right wing). His third wife donated it to the Chapel of the Vierschaar tribunal in Saint Basil's Church after his death	DAVID, Gerard	Triptych of Jan Des Trompes	Oil on wood, 129,7 x 96,6 cm (central panel), 132 x 43 cm (each wings)	1505	religious	Flemish	1501-1550

32825-37entom4.jpg	"Three compositions, executed in a delicate monochrome and showing the Theological Virtues (Faith, Hope and Charity), combine to form the predella of an altarpiece that Atalanta Baglioni commissioned from Raphael, possibly toward the middle of the year 1506, for the family chapel in the church of S. Francesco al Prato in Perugia. The noblewoman intended the work to commemorate her son, Grifonetto, who had been assassinated in July 1500 during the struggles between rival branches of her family to establish control over Perugia.The altarpiece was originally composed of a large central panel showing the Deposition of Christ (now in the Borghese Gallery, Rome), a pinnacle with God the Father, Blessing between Angels (painted by a pupil, now in the National Gallery of Umbria, Perugia), and the predella. Both the main panel and the predella were carried from Perugia to Rome by Pope Paul V. They were replaced by copies in 1608.Charity, which dominates the predella from its central position, is the most complex of the three predella figures. The tondo with the personification of the virtue has clearly been influenced by Michelangelo's Pitti Madonna; on one side a putto holds a flaming torch on its shoulders, while on the other a putto tips coins out of a bowl. Hope, forming the right-hand section of the predella, has at its centre the allegorical figure. On either side are putti in confident attitudes. Faith, traditionally identified by the chalice and host, is flanked by two small angels holding plaques with the Greek inscriptions ""CPX"" and ""IHS,"" alluding to the presence of Christ in the Eucharist."

02514-1vertum.jpg	There is no mistaking this masterpiece of fantasy and virtuoso imagination by Arcimboldo. The mythical Vertumnus (or Vortumnus), god of harvests and abundance, is in fact a bizarre portrait of the Habsburg Emperor Rudolf II. In the sixteenth century the emperor's cosmopolitan court in Prague became a centre of international art, where Arcimboldo moved in the refined and exclusive circles of late European Mannerism. His painting might appear almost irreverent, but in fact is the manifestation of his eager search for new ideas and his exploration of different ways of expression. (It also gives quite a good impression of the Emperor.) This led him to break the usual rules in order to provoke uncensored reactions and emotions. The paintings and objects contained in Rudolf of Habsburg's Wunderkammer (room of wonders) were unfortunately scattered after a Swedish army sacked Prague during the Thirty Years' War (1618-48)	ARCIMBOLDO, Giuseppe	Vertumnus	Oil on panel, 68 x 56 cm	c. 1590	mythological	Italian	1551-1600

04682-paulvirg.jpg	Bernardin de St. Pierre's Paul et Virginie (first published in 1788) became an immediate bestseller and continued inspiring songs, poems, plays, ballets, operas, and pictures well into the nineteenth century. It is the sentimental story of two children of French parentage growing up on a tropical island, the &#206;le de France (Mauritius), their love, separation, and untimely deaths. It appealed to the same readership that enjoyed historical romances and troubadour themes.This painting is unusual in the context of literary paintings for the large proportion of canvas given over to landscape rather than figures.

06337-01games.jpg	"The painting is referred to as the ""encyclopaedia of Flemish children's games"". It represents about 84 games some of them are practiced until present days. There is also an assumption that the painting is part of a four-piece cycle representing either the Four Seasons or the Ages of Man. If that was Bruegel's intention, it is unlikely that the series progressed beyond this painting, for there are no contemporary or subsequent mentions of related pictures.Bruegel has portrayed over 250 children on this panel. They are playing with pieces of wood, with bones, with hoops and barrels - specially crafted toys were rare in the 16th century. Their faces often appear ageless: perhaps the painter wished to warn the observer against frittering away his life as if it were a childlike game. The children, who range in age from toddlers to adolescents, roll hoops, walk on stilts, spin tops, ride hobby-horses, stage mock tournaments, play leap-frog and blind man's buff, perform handstands, inflate pigs' bladders and play with dolls and other toys. They have also taken over the large building that dominates the square: it may be a town hall or some other important civic building, in this way emphasizing the moral that the adults who direct civic affairs are as children in the sight of God. This crowded scene is to some extent relieved by the landscape in the top left-hand corner; but even here children are bathing in the river and playing on its banks.In addition to the games in the left part of the background a typical Flemish landscape, while on the right a street with excellent perspective can be seen"	BRUEGEL, Pieter the Elder	Children's Games	Oil on wood, 118 x 161 cm	1559-60	genre	Netherlandish	1501-1550
27144-ploos2.jpg	In the middle of the eighteenth century numerous native portraitists - in addition to a few foreigners - were active in Holland. They could be relied upon for truthful portrayals and good conversation pieces. The high level they could attain is seen in van der Mijn's small pendants of the wealthy timber merchant, great collector, and amateur artist Cornelis Ploos van Amstel and his wife Elizabeth Troost.At the time, Amsterdam's art world was closely knit. Elizabeth's sister Sarah married Ploos van Amstel's brother. and George van der Mijn was a close friend of his patron who had contact with the foremost artists, collectors, and intellectuals of the city.Van der Mijn portrait of Elizabeth Troost holding a small cup is as sympathetic as a Chardin lady.

In the centre, a maenad and a satyr dance and to the right other satyrs drink and putti play music.

17564-22portra.jpg	This well preserved painting represents the peak of Gossart's portraiture. In terms of its ambitious composition and the mastery illusion inn depicting such a wide variety of objects, it is unparalleled in his oeuvre. It joins a group of occupational portraits that had begun to appear by the middle of the fifteenth century, with examples such as St Eligius in His Workshop by Petrus Christus, and became increasingly popular in the early sixteenth century with paintings by Bernaert van Orley, Quentin Massys, Maerten van Heemskerck, Hans Holbein, and Marinus van Reymerswaele.The sitter of the present painting has been identified by the objects on his desk as either a banker or a merchant. According to a recent research, he is Jan Jacobsz. Snoeck (1510-1585), a descendant of a noble family of Gorinchem, who held important posts, including alderman, in his town	GOSSART, Jan	Portrait of a Man	Oil on oak panel, 64 x 48 cm	c. 1530	portrait	Flemish	1501-1550
31985-1deposi.jpg	The Deposition can perhaps justly be described as the artist's masterpiece. The compositional idea is extravagant and totally unprecedented: an inextricable knot of figures and drapes that pivots around the bewildered youth in the foreground and culminates above in the two lightly hovering figures emerging from vague background. This complicated bunch of forms arranged in the shape of an upturned pyramid defies any attempt at a rational exploration or identification of planes.The compositional complexity is accompanied by a significant and probably deliberate ambiguity in the representation of the subject, which may be interpreted as halfway between the theme of the Deposition and that of the Piet&#224; or Lamentation over the Dead Christ. The painting appears to represent the moment in which the body of Christ, having been taken down from the cross, has just been removed from the mother's lap. The Virgin, visibly distraught, and perhaps on the point of fainting, still glazes longingly towards her Son, and gestures with her right arm in the same direction. In the centre of the painting, the moment of the separation is underlined by the subtle contact of Mary's legs with those of Christ, now freed from his Mother's last pathetic embrace. The twisted body of Christ is reminiscent of Michelangelo's Vatican Piet&#224; (1498).An intense spiritual participation in the grief of the event profoundly affects the expressions and attitudes of all the figures present, even that of the woman turned away from the onlooker, probably Mary Magdalene, who communicates her anguished psychological condition by reaching out sympathetically towards the swooning body of the Virgin. Some scholars have interpreted the two young figures holding up the deceased's body as angels in the act of drawing Christ away from the main group and leading him finally into the arms of his Father. The general direction of the movement is, in fact, a rising one, and is created by the ethereal quality of the weightless figures, and their slow, almost dance-like rhythm. The two presumed angelic presences, moreover, seem to be unaffected by the weight of the lifeless body, and the figure in the foreground appears to be in the act of raising himself up by lightly pressing down on the front part of his foot.The intricately connected group of figures, involved in a highly dramatic atmosphere, takes on the appearance of a rich frieze in the harmony of highly refined colour tones of pinks, blues and greens. The transparent shadows do not annul the colours, but actually become them, in the flesh tones invested with subtle shades of pink and green.The cloaked man wearing a strange hat, almost imperceptible against the background of the painting behind the arm of the Virgin, may possibly be the artist himself. Staring at something beyond the confines of the painting and looking as though he were about to leave the pictorial space, he presents us with this complex and refined decoration of colours, forms	PONTORMO, Jacopo	Deposition	Oil on wood, 313 x 192 cm	c. 1528	religious	Italian	1501-1550

40127-poggio.jpg	Of all the Medici villas in the environs of Florence, Poggio Imperiale has the most imposing site and is also closest to the Palazzo Pitti, which became the official residence of the grand dukes in 1561. The property came into the possession of Cosimo I de' Medici in 1565. From 1618 Maria Magdalena of Austria, the wife of Cosimo II de' Medici invested  a great sum on improvements made under the direction of Giulio Parigi. In 1624 the property was officially named Poggio Imperiale with reference to the grand duchess's imperial lineage. The lineage was also featured in the ambitious pictorial program of the public rooms and bedrooms which lay on the ground floor. However, the villa was stripped of its precious furnishings and art treasures from the seventeenth century under the Habsburg-Lorraine regency (1737-65).The decoration of Poggio Imperiale started again under the reign of Peter Leopold (1747-1792) who succeeded his father as Grand Duke of Tuscany when his eldest brother became emperor as Joseph II in 1765. This decoration was intended to set a new artistic direction and propagate new standards of taste: Neoclassicism.Three rooms in the south wing were frescoed in 1768-72 by Tommaso Gherardini and Giuliano Traballesi with the collaboration of Giuseppe del Moro, one of the best Tuscan perspective painters of the time. It was followed by the decoration of five rooms in the west wing in 1773-78. Here the frescoes were executed by Giuseppe Maria Terreni, Giuseppe Gricci, Giuseppe del Moro, Giuseppe Antonio Fabbrini, and Tommaso Gherardini.The picture shows the ceiling painting in one of the rooms in the south suite of the Villa Poggio Imperiale. It depicts the Peace Offering of Emperor Augustus. It was painted by Giuliano Traballesi and the architecture painter Giuseppe del Moro.Costumed as pontifex maximus, Augustus is placing an offering on an altar, surrounded by other priests and military officers with their standards. In the foreground lie a bound captive, a sacrificial lamb, and a sacrificial bull. Looming in the background is a temple whose columns are wound with garlands, probably the Temple of Janus, whose doors were closed once peace was declared.Images showing the decorations of the various rooms in the Villa Poggio Imperiale can be viewd on the respective pages of Tommaso Gherardini, Giuliano Traballesi, Giuseppe del Moro, Giuseppe Maria Terreni, and Giuseppe Antonio Fabbrini	TRABALLESI, Giuliano	Ceiling decoration	Fresco	1769-70	mythological	Italian	1751-1800

20076-12freder.jpg	Because painters, with some famous exceptions, were considered craftsmen on the level of carpenters or masons, it was not normal for a prince in Holland to deal with them directly. However, Gerrit van Honthorst was able to work for all the courts and for several foreign ones as well. One advantage he had is that he was hired to paint portraits of the royals, giving them quality time with princes and princesses and a chance to charm them.The pair of this painting, depicting Amalia van Solms, wife of Stadholder Frederik Hendrik (now in the Musée Jacquemart-André, Paris) was painted by Rembrandt	HONTHORST, Gerrit van	Stadholder Frederik Hendrik, Prince of Orange	Oil on canvas, 77 x 61 cm	1631	portrait	Dutch	1601-1650

07160-canal201.jpg	"This is one of the four paintings ordered in 1725 from Canaletto by Stefano Conti, a textile merchant and collector from Lucca. Canaletto described the first painting, saying that it showed ""the Rialto Bridge from the side facing the Fondaco dei Tedeschi, across from the buildings where the magistrates of, for instance, the Camerlenghi work. These buildings border the market where all sorts of fruits and vegetables are unloaded for distribution to shops all over the city. Painted in the middle of the canal is a distinguished-looking sloop with figures in it being rowed swiftly across the water and, nearby, another gondola being rowed by the liveried servants of the imperial ambassador.""In these canvases Canaletto was apparently striving for the greatest verisimilitude, in which he succeeded by virtue of his great ingenuity and artistic sensibility. The curvature of the river is beautifully rendered in an arc flowing from the approaching sloop, under the dark bridge and on to the sunlit area beyond. This movement is effected by the curving roofline on the left and by the gondolas crossing the canal in the foreground, which binds the composition horizontally. As in so many other cases Canaletto was not the first to represent this particular cityscape; there is an early eighteenth-century print of the same subject by Filippo Vasconi which, in turn, is based on an etching by Israel Silvestre from the mid-seventeenth century.Here, too, Canaletto must have planned his composition with the help of two, now lost, preparatory drawings covering an angle of approximately ninety degrees. The compositional sketch (c. 1725, Ashmolean Museum, Oxford) for the painting has survived and in it we can see how the master combined the two views, creating an effect similar to that of a photograph produced by a wide-angle lens"	CANALETTO	The Grand Canal near the Ponte di Rialto	Oil on canvas, 90,5 x 134,6 cm	1725	landscape	Italian	1701-1750

26163-0546nati.jpg	The composition is a large-scale variant of the left wing of the Floreins triptych. So detailed are the figures in their execution and so precisely do the architecture and the landscape match Memling's style that an unknown work by the master must lie at its basis. After all, it is difficult to believe that a follower would be capable of producing such a penetrating, complex and monumental variant in the master's pure style of an existing small composition. The general pictorial treatment is harder and more contrasting than we are accustomed to in autograph works, and leans more towards the Master of the Legend of St Lucy. If it is indeed by that master, then it is his technically most accomplished work. It might also be based on a design provided by Memling which was executed by another painter (in his workshop?). The painting would appear at any rate to date from the final quarter of the fifteenth century. It was unknown until relatively recently.

15516-shepher.jpg	"""He painted in tempera, as a companion to this work, a Nativity of Christ which must excite the wonder of every thinking man, introducing his own portrait and some heads of shepherds, which are considered divine"" (Vasari).The Sassetti Chapel is consecrated to the birth of Christ, and as a result much in the chapel is conceived with that event in mind. The altarpiece the Adoration of the Shepherds is the chapel 's key work  not only in subject, but also in artistic merit. This composition was so successful that other artists frequently repeated it. Ghirlandaio himself appears in the scene, dressed as a shepherd. He is even allowed to come closer to the Christ Child than the donors, who appear in frescoes to the right and left, praying outside the confines of the panel. The artist, who is leading the shepherds, is kneeling and bringing the miracle of the birth of Christ to the attention of both the shepherds and the observers of the picture. His left hand, with which he is pointing to the Christ Child, is finely drawn and is superbly modelled in three dimensions. With his right hand, his painting hand, he is pointing to his chest, as he does in a later fresco in the Tornabuoni Chapel. As Ghirlandaio is pointing both at the child and the garlands on the Roman marble sarcophagus, it is possible that the gesture is saying: ""This holy child was painted for you by me, the garland-maker Ghirlandaio.""The classical sarcophagus in the picture is not just a manger for the ox and ass. It also has an iconographical significance indicated by the Latin inscription along its front: Ense cadens. Solymo. Pompei Pului[us] Augur Numen. Ait. Quae me conteg[it] Urna Dabit. [While Fulvi(us), augur of Pompey, was falling by the sword in Jerusalem he said: the urn that covers (conceals) me shall bring forth a god]. This is an ancient prophecy by Fulvius. The animals' manger will serve as a crib for the Christ Child. In his Adoration of the Shepherds, Ghirlandaio combines this reference to the Roman classical age with knowledge of Flemish art and turns them into an integrated whole.An historic event that took place a few years before this work was painted clearly left its mark behind on Ghirlandaio's work. An altarpiece ordered by Tommaso Portinari from Hugo van der Goes in Bruges reached Florence in May 1483. Florentine artists saw van der Goes' Adoration of the Shepherds as a shining comet showing new ways of painting. In Ghirlandaio's altarpiece, the shepherds pushing their way into the picture from the right, with their harsh, life-like features, are drawn directly from this Flemish model. Ghirlandaio's landscape in the background also displays features from north of the Alps"	GHIRLANDAIO, Domenico	Adoration of the Shepherds	Panel, 167 x 167 cm	1483-85	religious	Italian	1451-1500

05118-st_peter.jpg	"In 1377 Pope Gregory XI returned to Rome and the magnificent palace of Avignon became only the residence of antipopes. The popes' ""captivity in Babylon"" had terminated, but Avignon continued to act as a channel through which Italian Gothic art gradually penetrated further and further into the rest of Europe. It was in Avignon that Luis Borrassá first came into contact with 'court' Gothic, in the period around 1400, when this style was widely adopted in numbers of countries; it became in fact an international style founded upon all that Borrassá has learned from the brothers Serra.The painting in the church of Santa Maria in Terrasa illustrates the text from St. Matthew: 'And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishers. And he saith unto them: Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men. And they straightway left their nets, and followed him' (4, 19-20). This scene is connected with another one from the Gospel: 'Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship... the ship was now in the midst of the sea... Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea. And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled... And Peter said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water. And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus. But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink he cried, saying, Lord, save me. And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?' (Matthew 15, 22-31). Christ's face and his gesture are very beautiful, but the figures of both Christ and the two disciples are still stereotyped, differing in size in the traditional manner of early religious paintings: on the other hand, his treatment of the fishermen, particularly the one who is rowing, testifies to his own acute observation and his ability to make use of it.This altarpiece manifests a mixture of archaic technique and new characteristics of the International Gothic. The colour technique is Byzantine, but the shortening of the boats, the less sized figures in the background give some feeling of the perspective."

42322-1011vela.jpg	The young prince was a sickly child from birth, and he died at the age of four. He appears in this picture in a pink dress trimmed with silver, with a translucent pinafore over it, and bearing some striking accessories: various amulets were supposed to protect him against the evil eye, and an amber apple was thought to ward off infections. The bloodless face of the blue-eyed prince looks even paler due to the contrast with the silver highlights in his straw-coloured fair hair. Pale daylight falls in through the open door in the background. Otherwise, the room is full of shadows that seem to threaten the little figure.

04471-martha.jpg	Joachim Beuckelaer, the nephew and pupil of Pieter Aertsen, specialised in market scenes and genre paintings. Following the path opened up by his uncle, he responded to the growing demand of a prosperous bourgeoisie that wished to decorate their houses with works that reflected the lay character of their surroundings, whilst retaining a moral and religious significance.Jesus' visit to the house of Martha and Mary, taken from St Luke's Gospel, formed the basis of several representations from the mid-16th century onwards. In the religious context of the time, this scene illustrated one of the fundamental differences opposing Catholics and Protestants. The latter sought salvation in action whilst the former placed greater value on the contemplative life. Here the artist relegates the teaching of the divine word to the back of the painting, devoting the entire foreground to active life, incarnated by Martha, and in so doing juxtaposing a genre scene and a still-life. Like Aertsen, he assembles the domestic scene in his studio, drawing from a repertory of standard objects and utensils that he was to constantly reproduce elsewhere in various combinations. Again like Aertsen, he has borrowed from Serlio's treatise the Renaissance architecture in which he places his composition.However, it would be unfair to dismiss Beuckelaer as a mere follower. Rather the artist stands out by his extraordinary ability to reproduce textures in their full sensuousness, using a light and subtle stroke and a delicately gradated palette. With considerable virtuosity and delight he precisely depicts the varnished terracotta of the crocks, the flaccid skin of the plucked fowl, the starched but still supple serviettes, and the fragility of the hair drawn back over the kitchen-maid's temples. The soft greasiness of the meat or the velvety softness of the mallard duck are set against the flat glint of the tin pot and the glazed transparency of the cabochon glasses or berkemeier. A search for harmony guides him in the distribution of objects, colours, light and shade, in a careful composition that leaves nothing to chance.Multiplying the different levels of interpretation, the image moves beyond a simple illustration of the Gospel story to become a philosophical exegesis of visible reality. Invested with moral and symbolic content, each object reminds man of his carnal nature and warns him against the dangers of voluptuousness	BEUCKELAER, Joachim	Christ in the House of Martha and Mary	Oil on oak, 113 x 163 cm	1565	religious	Flemish	1551-1600
00965-05humili.jpg	In this painting, the image of Mary recalls the ideal of beauty promoted in International Gothic art, although her pose and shape give her a three-dimensionality and solidity closer to the art of Masaccio. The Virgin is placed, following the traditional iconography of the Virgin of Humility, on a cushion rather than a throne.The painting is notable for its brilliant and luminous palette, in which reds, blues and golds are harmoniously combined. Also outstanding is the sweetness and spirituality of the faces of the figures, whose poses and gestures are depicted with great naturalism	ANGELICO, Fra	The Virgin of Humility	Tempera on panel, 99 x 49 cm	1435-45	religious	Italian	1401-1450
18330-1304grec.jpg	This painting was made for the Capilla de San José (Chapel of Saint Joseph) in Toledo, originally it was placed on the left-hand side of the high altar. The paintings for the high altar (still in place) were the Saint Joseph and the Christ Child, and above, the Coronation of the Virgin; and, for the side altars, the Saint Martin and the Beggar and the Virgin and Child with Saints were placed.Clad in gold damascened armour with a ruff typical of fashionable Toledan dress in El Greco's day, St Martin is shown astride a white horse as he prepares to cut his bright green cloak in half in order to share it with the beggar who stands on the left. Below, a distant and freely painted view of Toledo shows the Alcántara bridge and the river Tagus. The gleaming whiteness of the horse and the shining gold-damascene work on Martin's armour contrast with the darkening sky behind.The painting is from the Widener Collection.

24208-oarsmen.jpg	Although officially considered a third member of the so-called German Romanists, Hans von Marées, long resident in Italy, moved far from the dramatic narrative of Böcklin or the ponderous perspective of Feuerbach. The Berlin-trained von Marées was Germany's major prophet of Modernism, filling a critical role as that nation's Puvis de Chavannes, the French master who was thirteen years his senior. Like Puvis de Chavannes, von Marées followed the Nazarene and Pre-Raphalite revival of wall painting. His major commission was the 1873 murals for the Library of the German Marine Zoological Station on Naples.The Oarsmen is a powerful study for one of the largest Library fresco, located on the north wall	MARÉES, Hans von	The Oarsmen	Oil on canvas, 136 x 167 cm	1873	genre	German	1851-1900

These offered van Gogh an opportunity to escape the flatland, to withdraw to a greater distance from where he commanded a panoramic view of the whole region. The figure of sower is depicted on the broad plain of La Crau. This painting follows van Gogh's depictions of the harvest, just as in reality the sower does his sowing only when the reaping has been completed and the fields are fallow.The figure of the sower is quoted from an early drawing by van Gogh in which he was copying Millet	GOGH, Vincent van	The Sower	Oil on canvas, 64 x 81 cm	June 1888, Arles	landscape	Dutch	1851-1900

33589-131portr.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 416.Rembrandt's colouristic power increases tremendously during his last period, although not all of his mature works display it; some of the single portraits remain largely monochromatic. The so-called Jewish Bride of c. 1665, which may be a commissioned portrait of a couple in the guise of a biblical pair (such as Isaac and Rebecca), belongs to his most brilliant colouristic creations. Even in reproductions it is possible to see something of the fluctuating quality of his late paint, the vibrations of the tones, and the harmonious fusion of the whole; but they can hardly suggest the warmth of the fiery scarlets, the golden yellows, the delicate blues and olives, the powerful whites, and deep blacks of his late palette. The broad, calm, relief-like arrangement of the life-size half-figures recalls a certain type of Venetian Renaissance painting. This reveals a touch of classical taste, but the use of colour in the portrait is quite unclassical.Like The Night Watch, this is another misnamed masterpiece by Rembrandt which it would be insensitive to re-title. To be sure, the painting does not represent a Jewish bridal couple in the sense which the nineteenth century, which invented the title, would have had in mind. The picture would then have been regarded as a romantic costume-piece, its very strangeness and aura of secretiveness suggesting that it showed some exotic rite, which was outside the experience of a predominantly Christian society.There can be no doubt, however, that an intimate relationship between the two figures was intended by the artist. The man places his hand on the woman's breast, while she moves instinctively to protect her modesty, in the classic pose of the Venus pudica which Rembrandt would have known from engravings or casts of classical statues. Yet the couple show every sign of tenderness towards each other, so this is not a common seduction scene (a frequent enough subject in Dutch painting). The theme most widely favoured by modern scholars is Isaac embracing his wife Rebecca while they were being spied on by Abimelech (Genesis, Chapter XXVI), which Rembrandt had previously represented in a drawing. To summarize the Bible narrative, Isaac, staying in the land of the Philistines, passes off Rebecca as his sister, because, if the Philistines had wanted to seduce her and had known she was Isaac's wife, they would have felt obliged to kill him first. One day, Abimelech, the Philistine King, observes the couple from a window making love in secret and guesses the truth, namely that they are man and wife. He reproves Isaac for the deception, pointing out that any man might have lain with Rebecca in all innocence, not realizing she was a married woman, and would thus have brought dishonour on himself and his people	REMBRANDT Harmenszoon van Rijn	The Jewish Bride	Oil on canvas, 122 x 167 cm	c. 1665	portrait	Dutch	1601-1650
08017-dukepast.jpg	The artist painted in Toledo and Madrid. Charles II, successor to Philip IV, viewed him with favour, and in 1669 he was made painter to the King. Although his religious paintings are of unusual quality, his main interest was painting portraits, the finest being that of the Duke Pastrana, now in the Prado.This mature portrait by Carre&#241;o, the impact of the dark and imposing, pyramidal figure of the Duke is counterbalanced by very delicate and melancholic coloring.

10292-04elect2.jpg	John the Steadfast (1468&#151;1532) was a member of the Ernestine line of the House of Wettin. During the lifetime of his brother, Elector Frederick the Wise, he became involved in the business of government. After his brother's death in 1525, John the Steadfast inherited the position of Elector and became Cranach's new master, in which role he proved no less benevolent than Frederick the Wise.One of Cranach's main duties as court painter consisted in portraying the Saxon princes as well as their families and allies. The portraits were not only intended as documentation of the line of descent for royal ancestral galleries, but also as gifts. The mutual exchange of portraits was a court custom, with the result that we know what John the Steadfast looked like from a number of paintings by Cranach.The present half-length portrait shows John the Steadfast in semi-profile at the age of 58. His arms are elided on the left and right edges of the painting, but the work's narrow format lends the portrait an expression of monumental immediacy. Moreover, the sitter stands out by virtue of the signet ring on his left hand, the chain around his neck bearing several rings and a small cross, and above all the rich embroidery on his shirt collar and the precious fur trim on his gown. The garland of carnations in his hair, traditionally worn at weddings, indicates that the portrait might have been painted on the occasion of the betrothal of the sitter's son, John Frederick the Magnanimous, to Sibylle of Cloves in 1526, and that the Elector is depicted here as the father of the groom	CRANACH, Lucas the Elder	Elector John the Steadfast of Saxony	Oil on lime wood panel, 57 x 37 cm	1526	portrait	German	1501-1550

To enhance its poignant realism, the artist foreshortened Christ's lowered head and torso from the perspective of the kneeling worshipper. The slender, idealized body is anatomically detailed and luminously modelled. The inscriptions - in Hebrew, Greek and Latin - on the titulus of the cross identify Christ as 'Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews.

17094-1arles06.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 412 JH 1440.Van Gogh's production in Arles fell into a number of series, one of which comprised landscape paintings on the theme of the seasons. The original idea for a seasonal series, in which each season would be represented by a pair of complementary colours, had been put forward in Nuenen in 1884. On arrival in Arles in March 1888 van Gogh began to paint a series of canvases of blossoming orchards in pinks and greens entitled Spring. In June he painted Summer in blue and orange, represented by the harvest on the plain of La Crau, which lay between Arles and the ruined monastery of Montmajour. The painting is a pendant of the Haystacks in Provence (F 425). It was an important work for van Gogh; he made two preliminary drawings of the motif and when the painting was finished he made two further drawings after it.In the painting, the viewpoint is high and thus the great plain is laid out beneath us, receding more gradually to the distant towers of Montmajour and the hills beyond. Van Gogh often described the plain of La Crau in his letters, saying that apart from differences of colour it reminded him constantly of Holland, but not of modern Holland. In this landscape he saw the landscape paintings of the seventeenth-century artists Ruisdael and De Koninck, who were both famous for their panoramic landscapes	GOGH, Vincent van	Harvest at La Crau (The Blue Cart)	Oil on canvas, 73 x 92 cm	June 1888, Arles	landscape	Dutch	1851-1900

It depicts the extensive interior of a private residence which is furnished with a wooden coffered ceiling and a tiled floor. In the centre of the picture a pillared walkway divides the room into two areas. The left half of the picture is missing considerable sections of paint. The depiction of a person sitting at a table has been almost totally destroyed. Nonetheless, the remaining fragments make it possible to identify him. He must be a Franciscan monk, for the lower part of his monastic attire is still visible.The picture combines three scenes: in the left half of a pillared hall with two aisles and a coffered ceiling, St. Francis is prophesying the Knight of Celano's imminent death and begging him to make his confession. The events continue chronologically on the right of the picture. The nobleman's confession to the Franciscan monk is followed in the background by his sudden death.The inscription reads: QUANDO BS. F. FUIT INVITATUS AD PRANDIUM A COMITE DE CELANO ET TU(N)C B. F. PR(A)EDIXIT SUAM MORTEM - ""How St Francis was invited to a meal by the knight of Celano, whose death was prophesied by St Francis."

38631-witches.jpg	The Witches' Initiation was a popular subject in the circles of the Saftleven brothers in Rotterdam. In Teniers's version the witching is taking place in the distant background, where a young, naked witch with a broomstick between her legs is being anointed before she flies off through the gaping hearth.

15588-06tondo.jpg	In 1487, Ghirlandaio painted another Adoration of the Magi, a large circular painting for the Tornabuoni family. The date is confirmed by Roman numerals: MCCCCLXXXVII.Such tondos were particularly popular as decorative items in private rooms, and their circular form required a particularly skillful composition. In the centre the childlike Mary is enthroned with her child. In the background, behind the ruined arcades of a classical building, is a simple hut that provides the ox and ass with a stable and the holy family with shelter. The kings' large retinues are lined up right to the ruin, and only behind the Madonna is there a circle of empty space. In other words the composition is influenced by the form of the panel.On the left is a lovely group of four soldiers with helmets and lances, looking in various directions. The soldiers have four horses that are also looking in different directions. Their pendant on the right, further back, is a group of four other soldiers in magnificent contemporary armor. The horses in front of the ruin are also very successful, and in them Ghirlandaio showed that he was also capable of depicting animals with strong foreshortening and from various angles. The contrast between the magnificent gray stallion and the darker gray ass is surely intentional. Above these animals the observer's gaze wanders through the open arched architecture of the classical ruin out into the far distance. There, painted in an atmospheric paleness, is a city surrounded by water and reminiscent of Venice.The composition of this Adoration contains allusions to the unique panel created in 1481 by Leonardo da Vinci, now in the Galleria degli Uffizi. Though Leonardo never completed this work, it had an enormous influence on the artists of his age. Ghirlandaio adopted the pyramidal composition of the main figures, with Mary at the top. The circular empty space behind Mary in the tondo might also have been inspired by Leonardo's picture.A replica of this tondo, in smaller dimensions and entirely the work of Domenico's shop, is to be found in the Galleria Palatina at Palazzo Pitti in Florence	GHIRLANDAIO, Domenico	Adoration of the Magi	Tempera on wood, diameter: 171 cm	1487	religious	Italian	1451-1500

06606-singerie.jpg	The theme of the 'singerie' was to become widespread in north European art towards the middle of the 17th century, especially in Flanders where artists such as David Teniers the Younger created entire societies out of monkeys dressed as men. Such scenes were intended to allegorise the futility of man's possessions and actions. Singerie is the French word for 'Monkey Trick'. It is a genre depicting monkeys aping human behaviour, often fashionably attired, intended as a diverting sight, always with a gentle cast of mild satire.In the present painting it is assumed that the seven monkeys populating the foreground and the four sitting on the draped table surrounding the plate of fruit to be by Jan Brueghel the Elder, with the remaining parts by his son and chief studio assistant at this time, Jan Brueghel the Younger.

00003-rudolf2.jpg	Rudolph II (1552-1612) was the son of the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II. He became King of Hungary in 1572 and King of Bohemia in 1575. Following the death of his father he also became Holy Roman Emperor and Archduke of Austria. His reign was a troubled time of great religious conflicts coupled with the external menace of the Turks. Unfortunately, politics was not a great interest of his. Instead he was familiar with a number of languages and was devoted to art and science, the latter including alchemy and astrology, a highly fashionable preoccupation at that time. He was also fascinated by magic and the occult. At the end of the 1590s mental illness rendered him incapable of governing his empire, which by that time was torn by disputes between Reformation and Counter-Reformation movements. As a result, in 1611, he was forced to cede the crown of Bohemia to his brother Matthias and he died soon afterwards	AACHEN, Hans von	Portrait of Emperor Rudolf II	Oil on canvas, 60 x 48 cm	1590s	portrait	German	1601-1650
17815-719goya.jpg	The participation of flagellants in Holy Week processions in Spain was banned in 1777 but evidently not effectively since the ban was published again in 1779 and 1802. Goya's known hatred of fanaticism, explicit in many later drawings and engravings, suggests that his choice of subject was intended as an indictment of this form of public penance. So does his manner of recording the scene. The holy image of the Virgin is silhouetted against the dark wall of the church and the blood-stained figures of the flagellants stand out from and dominate the procession.An Inquisition scene in the same series is similar in character. Both paintings combine realistic reportage with critical intent in a manner, often seeming to approach caricature, which is peculiar to Goya.

23342-07ponte1.jpg	The Angel and the Virgin of the Annunciation are the two upper panels of the polyptych executed by Lotto for the small village Ponteranica in a valley north of Bergamo. The other panels were probably partly completed by assistants, while the protagonists of the Annunciation are among the most fascinating images of Lotto's maturity. Lotto, who was very fond of the theme of the announcement that Mary was to give birth to the son of God, presented the episode in various ways. Here the evocation of the iridescent, almost incorporeal angel confers a dream-like fascination on the event, which is, however, placed on a plane of worldly normality by the Virgin's gesture and expression.The angel in the upper left compartment of the polyptych is one of the most lyric creations of Lotto	LOTTO, Lorenzo	Angel Annunciating	Oil on wood, 75 x 55 cm	1527	religious	Italian	1501-1550

11198-1880s_18.jpg	After 1880 Degas also explored the theme of women bathing. French artists devoted a significant part of their work to the praise of woman's beauty, albeit less in the nineteenth than in the eighteenth century. Unlike to his predecessors, Degas describes intimate scenes without intimacy, bodies without sensuality. The women bathing, washing, drying themselves, combing their hair or having it combed, are mainly seen from behind. They do not seem to heed the intimacy of the boudoir or bathroom scene. Degas's matter-of-fact depictions of woman was criticized by his contemporaries	DEGAS, Edgar	The Tub	Pastel on paper, 70 x 70 cm	1885-86	genre	French	1851-1900
18264-0803grec.jpg	El Greco painted many representations of St Francis, all showing him in meditation, receiving the stigmata or experiencing a vision. Devotion to St Francis was highly developed in Spain, and in El Greco's time there were in Toledo alone ten Franciscan religious institutions. Many ordinary Toledans were members of the Third Order of Saint Francis, established so that lay people could participate in the spiritual life of the Franciscans. (El Greco himself was a lay Franciscan.) This serves to explain the success of El Greco's images of the saint.

36591-triumph.jpg	This large tondo featuring the Triumph of Fame on its front side was painted to celebrate the birth of Lorenzo de' Medici who was later known as Lorenzo il Magnifico. This is one of many examples of such two-sided tondi painted for Florentine families, although exactly how they were used is still uncertain.The theme chosen for this one derived from the Triumphs of Petrarch and Boccaccio's The Vision of Love. Trumpets announce the arrival of Fame from the globe on which the allegorical figure stands and knights arrive to honour her.The feathers on the frame are a reference to Lorenzo's father Piero de Gouty, and the reverse of the tondo features other references to the Medici, as well as to the family of Lorenzo's mother, Lucrezia Tornabuoni	SCHEGGIA	Triumph of Fame (a Birth Salver)	Tempera, silver and gold on wood, diameter 93 cm (with frame)	c. 1449	other	Italian	1401-1450

He opposed the Reformation and supported the Wittelsbach cause against the Habsburg monarchs.The identification of the portrait is based on an engraving bearing the initials of Barthel Beham that also provides the name of the sitter, his age (47) and the date (1527). It is proposed that both the painting and the engraving are based on a now-lost drawing by the artist	BEHAM, Barthel	Chancellor Leonhard van Eck	Oil on spruce panel, 56 x 38 cm	1527	portrait	German	1501-1550
19086-04nooff.jpg	The portrait of the Officers of the St George Civic Guard is the first major group portrait by Frans Hals, and the first monumental civic guard painting in the new era of Dutch painting. Together with the leaders of public, charitable and professional associations, the civic guard societies were the main patrons to commission group portraits. This patronage took on considerable proportions in the course of the century. These group portraits are also of value as historical documents, for which lists were drawn up giving the names of the figures portrayed. The paintings themselves were displayed prominently on the premises of the respective association.These civic guard portraits were an expression of the Baroque will to representation, whose tradition is rooted in the medieval era. There had been civic guards in the Netherlands since the 13th century. They had played an important role in the emancipation of the cities and towns from feudal rule and had gained considerable political and military significance in the Netherlands' struggle for independence.Cornelis van Haarlem had already painted the officers of the St George Civic Guard in 1599. Hals, however, revolutionizes this type of painting. Instead of merely painting a row of individual portraits, he places them within a specific context by creating a banquet scene. This is not simply a moment captured at a table, but an extremely witty and calculated composition in which a scenic context is created between all the figures involved, and, on the other hand, each of the figures poses and acts independently and individually. Hals has found a new and persuasive solution to the problem of portraying a large group without difference of rank.Hals seems to have arranged the officers casually around the festive board. But this is not the case. The places they occupy are in strict accord with military protocol. The colonel, the company's highest ranking officer, is seated at the head of the table; at his right is the provost, the second ranking officer. They are flanked by the company's three captains and the three lieutenants are at the lower end of the table. The three ensigns, who were not members of the officer corps, and the servant stand. Hals other group portraits of officers at banquet tables, which look equally informal, follow a similar hierarchical arrangement	HALS, Frans	Banquet of the Officers of the St George Civic Guard	Oil on canvas, 175 x 324 cm	1616	portrait	Dutch	1601-1650

30406-madchild.jpg	"In the inventory of Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini's paintings compiled by Giovanni Battista Agucchi in 1603, a double-sided picture is mentioned, with a Nativity on one side and a Madonna on the other. In 1638 the painting was left by Ippolito Aldobrandini to his only niece Olimpia, who had married for a second time to Camillo Pamphilj senior. In a list of the same property made prior to 1665, the work is recorded as still being in one piece, ""with gilded frame at the front of the Parmigianino [and] with a pedestal covered with crimson velvet and gold trimming."" The work was obviously held in high regard, and probably intended, from the outset, for use as a small altar for private devotion.The votive picture was still in this state in 1709 and only subsequently split into two separate parts. Before this investigation of the archives was carried out, the two pictures had been considered two separate works intended as companion pieces. Curiously, in 1603 Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini's collection contained another small Nativity surrounded by angels, also by Parmigianino but not the same as the one here.This delightful example of sacred painting with its curved and supple lines, in which the Madonna with her hands joined in moving and gentle spirituality and the Child with a dove perched on an open book, undoubtedly inspired by Correggio, are set against a background of trees stirred by a light breeze, probably dates from around 1525. It would therefore have been painted at the time of the Fontanellato frescoes, that is prior to the artist's stay in Rome"	PARMIGIANINO	Madonna and Child	Oil on panel (arched), 58,8 x 34,1 cm	c. 1525	religious	Italian	1501-1550
29282-214muril.jpg	According to tradition, the models were from the province of Galicia and attained a certain notoriety as courtesans in Seville. A man of the people, Murillo obviously intended this picture to both surprise and amuse the spectator. Yet the casualness of this painting masks a sure sense design - note how the girls' heads form a diagonal that bisects the canvas - and great technical skill. Although he had begun by selling his pictures at fairs, Murillo became conversant with and influenced by the works of Velázquez, Titian and Rubens, presumably as a result of studying the royal collections in Madrid. But Murillo never lost his popular appeal or his gift for the telling expression, such as the smile of the uppermost woman, indicated only by her eyes and cheeks	MURILLO, Bartolomé Esteban	A Girl and her Duenna	Oil on canvas, 106 x 127 cm	1670	genre	Spanish	1651-1700
39630-2rabbit.jpg	"In 1529  Federico Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua ordered three more works from Titian. The only one to survive is probably identifiable with the Madonna and Child with St Catherine and a Shepherd, known as the Madonna of the Rabbit. With a look of winning encouragement the Virgin restrains the rabbit, a symbol of fecundity, so that the child can clamber down and play with it. The richly dressed St Catherine, proffering her charge like a lady-in- waiting, introduces a courtly aspect, and in fact the Giorgionesque shepherd in the background may be a portrait of Federico himself: Since x-rays show that the Madonna's head was originally turned in his direction. In the foreground, the delicate wild flowers recall the locus amoenus or ""idyllic setting"" of classical poetry, and in the park-like landscape we see the Arcadia of the Concert Champ&#234;tre refracted through the smiling fertility of the Ferrara Bacchanals. Nowhere else does Titian so successfully integrate the traditions of the Sacra Conversazione and the Pastoral.This painting mainly captivates through the beauty of its colours and the marvellous landscape. The small format is a sign that this was a private devotional picture. What at first sight appears to be a normal picture of the Madonna gains an additional, very private dimension as a result"	TIZIANO Vecellio	Madonna and Child with St Catherine and a Rabbit	Oil on canvas, 74 x 84 cm	1530	religious	Italian	1501-1550
04836-vanitas.jpg	The painting shows a sarcophagus in a half-ruined church, with its vanishing point on the left. Objects of vanity are assembled in the foreground, piled up in the shape of a pyramid and culminating in an ermine coat, a turban (at the very top, at the banister, next to the skull), a royal crown, a mitre and a globe. These symbols of secular and ecclesiastical power at the zenith of the composition are further explained by a richly decorated bowl, worked by a goldsmith. It shows mythological scenes of unhappy love relationships, partly covering those 'vanitates' which are of lower order - a tambourine, lute, sabre, coat of mail and painter's palette, to name but a few. The statue of a mourning female figure in one of the niches bears great resemblance to the woman whose contours can be seen in Nicolas Poussin's famous self-portrait  at the Louvre. She can be regarded as a late successor to the weeping women who surround the altar tomb of Philip the Bold in Dijon.Pieter Boel's painting contains all the features normally associated with baroque solemnity, i.e. pomp and splendour even where power and wealth have become subject to the darkness of death. However, although all earthly possessions and authority are marked as vain, the dialectic of the painting never leaves any doubt that their real substance remains undisputed in this world and that the earthly order is preserved intact	BOEL, Pieter	Large Vanitas Still-Life	Oil on canvas, 207 x 260 cm	1663	still-life	Flemish	1651-1700

10001-lastjudg.jpg	This work illustrate the influence exerted in the Low Countries by the Italian Renaissance. A variety of artists made the journey to Italy in the 16th century, where they absorbed the new artistic ideas. Their work brought an entirely new approach to religious painting compared to the pious, inward-looking art of the 15th century. Novel elements included brilliant compositions and above all the heightened attention to the human body - a focus that led to frequent exaggeration.Coxcie's Last Judgment is a rather unsuccessful attempt to match the anatomical skills of the great Italian masters. It was painted for the Town Hall in Ghent, to replace a 15th-century Last Judgment that was destroyed during the mid-16th-century Iconoclasm.

35538-01medici.jpg	Thanks to his organisational capacities, Rubens could meet demand and revolutionise the problem of large-scale pictorial decoration. His renown extended well beyond the frontiers of his country, and in 1621 Marie de Médicis, widow of Henri IV of France and mother of the reigning king Louis XIII, invited him to Paris. She wished him to decorate one of the galleries of the newly built Palais de Luxembourg with 24 monumental paintings commemorating episodes in the lives of herself and her renowned husband. The creation of a cycle of tapestries had, in a sense, been Rubens' technical apprenticeship for this demanding task, the composition of a cycle of vast narrative paintings dedicated to a living queen who had already entered history.Giving epic treatment to this biographical subject, Rubens was also able to give free rein to his fertile invention. He prepared two series of oil sketches, with detailed figures drawn in, which it then fell to his assistants to scale up to the dimensions of the canvases commissioned. These were then meticulously retouched by the master so that they might be ultimately be described, at least in the final layers of paint, as his own works. The entire commission was completed in only three years.All of his prodigious culture was drawn on for these works: his encyclopaedic knowledge of classical mythology was exploited to the full in transforming the queen's entire career - Henri slipped rather into the background - into a kind of operatic sequence largely of Rubens' own invention. Metamorphosing life into myth, he freely mingled historical personages with the gods of Olympus, who came to represent them. The scheme of this apparatus was invented as he went along, the - often gratuitous - interpolations of the divine gracefully leavening the uneventful royal life. It had required all of Rubens' imaginative resources and natural verve to ennoble and illustrate the relatively colourless circumstances of the Queen Mother's life. These qualities were essential; Rubens' international renown depended on his success in this formidable commission. His solution was to populate his compositions with nude goddesses, pagan gods, curvaceous undines, mischievous tritons, and genii unspecified. His customary contrasts are at work in the playful opposition of gleaming cuirasses and lusty bodies, fragile silks and the rugged hulls of dreadnoughts. The poverty of his subject was utterly transcended; this is pure painting, nothing but painting.Certainly, it was not the rather heavy features of the Medici family, particularly evident in the queen, that had attracted Henri IV, but the scale of her dowry. Rubens nevertheless contrived to render her portrait agreeable. He disguised her now as an attractive Bellona, now as a proud horsewoman in The Capture of Juliers.

37530-5domeni.jpg	In the Cappella di Santa Caterina of the Sienese church of San Domenico, Sodoma's mural paintings dominate the decoration. The chapel was built in the late fifteenth century to house the relic of St Catherine's head in a marble tabernacle. Sodoma transformed the space to appear as if it were an open loggia resting on piers. The real altar is continued to the side as a painted balustrade, above which, in a wide opening on the left Catherine is seen fainting and, on the right, in ecstasy.Only the left-hand wall showing Catherine saving the soul of Niccol&#242; di Tuldo was completed by Sodoma. Here the artist uses particular means to bring us close to the scene: the lower balustrade is wide open; steps seem to lead out of the chapel to the site of the execution	SODOMA, Il	View of the Cappella di Santa Caterina	Fresco	1526	religious	Italian	1501-1550
39795-18barbar.jpg	This portrait is considered to be a replica in his own hand of an almost identical portrait in the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, which identifies the subject as Daniele Barbaro in an inscription. The picture in Ottawa is probably that mentioned in 1545 in a letter from Pietro Aretino, which once belonged to the portrait collection of Paolo Giovio in Como. With the body turned slightly to the right and the grave, spiritual face framed by the beard and hair, Daniele Barbaro's gaze is fixed on the viewer. His black gown reveals scarcely anything except the left hand and the book, which, as an attribute of scholarship, alludes to Barbaro's humanistic education. Barbaro was hardly 30 years old at this date	TIZIANO Vecellio	Daniele Barbaro	Oil on canvas, 81 x 69 cm	1545	portrait	Italian	1501-1550
11016-410david.jpg	While Pope Pius VII remained in Paris after the consecration, David also painted his portrait and thereby joined an illustrious band of past artists - Raphael, Titian and Velázquez - as the painter of a pontiff. David broke with protocol by sitting down while he worked, as previously tradition had dictated that the humble artist should kneel to paint the Pope. David, though, did appreciate the honour bestowed upon him and apparently put on fine clothes and wore a sword as he worked. He responded warmly to the venerable old pontiff and was both delighted and moved by the benediction that he received from the hand of Pius	DAVID, Jacques-Louis	Portrait of Pope Pius VII	Oil on canvas, 86 x 71 cm	1805	portrait	French	1801-1850
39752-01schiav.jpg	The portraits from the early period of Titian are strongly realistic. Among them the portrait of a woman, called La Schiavone, is of remarkably fine quality. Titian poses his sitters in such a way as to make the most of a novel compositional idea; the figures stand out in bold relief against the plain background and the colour emphasizes the unusual lighting, revealing the mood of the sitters as well as capturing their physical presence.The inclusion of the sitter's portrait carved in stone may refer to the much discussed issue of the relative merits of painting and sculpture	TIZIANO Vecellio	Portrait of a Woman (La Schiavona)	Oil on canvas, 117 x 97 cm	1508-10	portrait	Italian	1501-1550

42809-3baptist.jpg	The extraordinary beauty of the Venetian fabrics already to be found in the work of Palma il Vecchio is brought to unrivalled perfection by Paolo Veronese. In the St John the Baptist Preaching (c. 1562), which heralds the coming of Christ, the figures are wrapped in magnificent oriental silk robes and three are wearing turbans. Their differing reactions to the sermon are reflected in their facial expressions. The skilful composition of the painting creates a balance between the weight of the group of figures on the right and the perspective on the left	VERONESE, Paolo	St John the Baptist Preaching	Oil on canvas, 205 x 169 cm	c. 1562	religious	Italian	1551-1600

05165-2borsos.jpg	This painting is a fine example of the Viennese influence on Hungarian genre painting.In Borsos' picture, brocades, pleats, ribbons, jewels, candelabra, fashion magazines and carpet patterns rival one another in depicting the atmosphere after the girls' ball and the grandiose surroundings. The artist arranged the scene himself  as if it were a tableau vivante according to the fashion of those days. Borsos, who portrayed the life of  the upper class,  tested himself as a stage director. The spell of the night, gossip and musing, a kind of freshness which made the artist want to arrest the irrevocable charm of the moment. The artist's daughter was one of the models.

10246-1founta1.jpg	Cranach's painting is about the human yearning for immortality and eternal youth. Human beings dream of being young again, of leaving the worn outer shell and exchanging it for a new one. The notion of the cleansing power of the elements, especially of water, is as old as humankind itself. The centre of the scene is a pool filled with water. Some steps lead down to the pool, which is surrounded by a fantastic landscape far from civilisation. People have undertaken arduous journeys to reach this solitary spot and bathe in the miraculous waters.In the left half of the picture wrinkled and frail old women are brought up on carts and stretchers. They are undressed and examined by a doctor before stepping into the water where the gradual process of rejuvenation takes place. Their wrinkles and old sallow skin disappear, their flesh becomes rosy and smooth, and they turn into young girls. As they emerge from the water they are welcomed by a cavalier who shows them to a tent where they receive new clothes. Old peasant women are transformed into young ladies of the court who indulge in the carefree pleasures of life. The jollifications at the festive table, the dancing, music and lovemaking, all take place in a lush flowering landscape. These are the realms of eternal youth, to which the hardships of old age, set in a barren rocky landscape on the left side of the picture, form a stark contrast.The fountain spouting water from the spring into the pool bears the statues of Venus and Cupid - evidence that this is actually a fountain of love rather than youth, and that the power of love is the true source of immortality	CRANACH, Lucas the Elder	The Fountain of Youth	Lime panel, 122,5 x 186,5 cm	1546	mythological	German	1501-1550
43381-triptych.jpg	In this grandiose triptych Antonio Vivarini, helped by his brother-in-law Giovanni d'Alemagna (active 1441-1450), achieved a highpoint of balance between the International Gothic tradition now in decline, and the rising Renaissance. A natural light lends tenderness to the holy figures. The Virgin, however, sits rigid like a Byzantine empress on a Gothic throne, surrounded by Masolinoesque angels who are holding the poles of the high canopy almost as if it were a game. The saints Gregory and Jerome on the left and Ambrose and Augustine on the right, stand immobile in their heavy ecclesiastical garments shining with gold and colour. The holy scene appears constrained by the marble walls with their Gothic fretwork, set in a perspective as improbable as it is ostentatious. The sumptuous static scene is a final dazzling reminder of a fairy-tale world	VIVARINI, Antonio	Triptych	Tempera on panel, 339 x 200 cm (central), 339 x 138 cm (each side)	1446	religious	Italian	1401-1450
09698-04sabine.jpg	The Sacchetti family commissioned this painting in the 1620s when Pietro da Cortona was just making his name in Roman circles. They thus became his first patrons and introduced him to the world of aristocratic commissions. During the first two decades of the century, Caravaggio's naturalistic style had been rivaled by the Carracci cousins' academic style of classicism. Each school had its own followers and some attempts had been made to bring the two together. The arrival of Pietro da Cortona, at the same time as Bernini erupted onto the scene as the preferred sculptor and architect of the Barberini pope Urban VIII, were together sufficient to transform art in Rome and to create a true Baroque style.Pietro da Cortona's painting stands out for its open theatricality, lively gestures, richness of colour, and brushwork, as well as its diffused light. The Sabine women being lifted into the air deliberately derive from Bernini's works, such as Apollo and Daphne, as if to underline the bond between the two artists. There is little real violence in his treatment of this scene from Roman legend, merely a splendidly theatrical display of half-clothed bodies	CORTONA, Pietro da	The Rape of the Sabine Women	Oil on canvas, 280,5 x 426 cm	1627-29	historical	Italian	1601-1650
35708-jewish_c.jpg	Ruins sometimes play a prominent role, and gloomy skies set a melancholy mood. Ruisdael's rare ability to create a compelling and tragic mood in nature is best seen in his famous Jewish Cemetery at Dresden. A larger, more elaborate autograph version is at the Detroit Institute of Arts. These works are moralizing landscapes that were painted with a deliberate allegorical programme. The combination of their conspicuous tombs, ruins, large dead beech trees, broken trunks, and rushing streams alludes to the familiar themes of transience and the vanity of life and the ultimate futility of human endeavour, while the burst of light that breaks through the ravening clouds in each painting, their rainbows and the luxuriant growth that contrasts with the dead trees offer a promise of hope and renewed life.The masterliness of the Dresden painting lies in the artist's clear and concentrated presentation of these ideas. The eye focuses on the three tombs in the middle distance, where the light is centralized. They present a truthful picture of the actual, identifiable sarcophagi as they can still be seen in the Portuguese-Jewish Cemetery at Ouderkerk on the Amstel River near Amsterdam. Ruisdael made carefully worked-up drawings of the tombs, one of which he used as a preparatory drawing for the paintings. But the landscape settings of the Dresden and Detroit paintings bear no resemblance whatsoever to the site at Ouderkerk. They are Ruisdael's inventions. The cemetery never had monumental ruins. Those seen in the Dresden version were transplants from the shattered remains of Egmond Castle near Alkmaar, a site about forty kilometres from Ouderkerk; they also are based on a preparatory drawing. The ruins seen in the Detroit painting are probably derived from the ruins of Egmond's old Abbey Church. A rushing stream does not bisect the actual burial ground. (Would anyone in his right mind place tombs near a vigorous stream which would wreak havoc with the tombstones and coffins beneath them when it flooded?) The stream was included as a traditional allusion to the passage of time. Most remarkable is the barren beech tree in the Dresden picture that gestures toward the three tombs and heavenwards. If ever a tree was capable of seducing a viewer to accept the pathetic fallacy of endowing natural forms with human feelings and emotions it is this dead beech.The iconographical programme of Ruisdael's two versions of the Jewish Cemetery leaves no doubt that they were intended as moralizing landscapes. He made no others that can be given a similar unmistakable reading. None of his other existing paintings include tombs; those done by his contemporaries are rare, and some of them are based on his depictions of the sarcophagi at Ouderkerk. However, Ruisdael made numerous pictures that include identifiable or imaginary ruins, dead and broken trees, rushing streams, rivers, and waterfalls. Were these motifs invariably intended by the artist as symbols of transience and the vanity of life, and does the handful of them that include rainbows allude to hope? It has been argued that this is indeed the case, and that these motifs not only offer the iconographical essence of Ruisdael's landscapes but offer the key to the meaning to seventeenth-century landscape painting. According to this interpretation they were intended as visual sermons to convey the biblical message that man lives in a transient world beset by sinful temptation, but may hope for salvation	RUISDAEL, Jacob Isaackszon van	The Jewish Cemetery	Oil on canvas, 141 x 183 cm	c 1657	landscape	Dutch	1651-1700

Later, when the Troyan were washed ashore near Carthage after the storm at sea, Aeneas and his friend Achates set out to explore Venus appeared once more, this time with bow and quiver disguised as a huntress, to direct them to Dido's palace.This painting depicts the moment in which Venus appears to the Trojan warriors disguised as a huntress and directs them to Queen Dido's palace	GIMIGNANI, Giacinto	Venus Appearing to Aeneas and Achates	Oil on canvas, 122 x 170 cm	-	religious	Italian	1601-1650

00124-marketst.jpg	The painting demonstrates a wide range of agricultural products, made possible by the improvements in production methods. Offering her fruits and vegetables, the woman is almost an appendage to her produce. Despite all exaggeration, the picture quite adequately shows the new economic prosperity of the time. At the same time, however, it still contains a background scene in genre style of embracing lovers in a stable, thus relating the painting to late medieval peasant satires.

07597-57salome.jpg	On his way back to Rome Caravaggio returned to Naples. This harsh late work has none of the beauty of some of the late Sicilian pictures, such as the altarpiece stolen from the Oratory of San Lorenzo in Palermo, and it may reflect the assault Caravaggio endured in the Osteria del Cerriglio in the city. A sense of the tired mood of one aware of the pointlessness of a ruthless vendetta pervades the painting.The Baptist has been executed for denouncing Salome's mother Herodias over her illicit marriage with Herod. Caravaggio uses the device of planting two heads - Salome's and her maid's (or her mother's) - so close together that they seem to grow out of one body as the contrasting stages of youth and age. This had been a trait of Leonardo's, and the way that the head of St John is presented to the spectator recalls a picture by Leonardo's pupil Luini, whose Salome also looks away from her victim. The executioner takes no joy in what he has been commanded to do. He feels only a stunned emotion in keeping with the sombre tones that Caravaggio adopts.You can view other depictions of Salome with the Head of John the Baptist.

33433-01oldtes.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 486.This painting dates from shortly after Rembrandt had set up as an independent artist in Leiden in 1625. The subject is taken from the Apocryphal Book of Tobit (Chapter II, vv, 11-14). Tobit was a wealthy, God-fearing Jew, strict in his observance of the Mosaic law, who had lost all his money and been blinded in an accident. To keep them from starving, his wife Anna took in sewing and washing. One day, hearing the bleating of a kid which Anna had been given to supplement her earnings, Tobit falsely accuses her of having stolen it. In return, she upbraids him for his self-righteousness which has brought them to their present plight (this is the scene represented in the picture). Later, however, the couple's fortunes are restored by their son, Tobias, who goes to find the money his father has lost and to marry a rich wife. On the way he meets the Angel Raphael, who instructs him when they come to a river to catch a large fish, the entrails of which are afterwards applied to Tobit's eyes to cure his blindness.In this work Rembrandt depicts the psychological tension between the two protagonists. The mood of the blind old Tobit suddenly becomes one of suspicion and despair when he wonders how his wife, Anna, has managed to lay hands on a kid. She in turn is baffled by his mistrust.The space depicted is confined but packed with domestic detail: onions hanging up by the window, a basket on the wall, cooking utensils on the shelves, part of Anna's sewing apparatus glimpsed between the two figures, and, in the foreground, Tobit's stick, his dog and a modest fire.Such meticulously painted still-life detail had been a characteristic of Netherlandish art since the fifteenth century. However, in contrast to so many examples of its use up to and including the seventeenth century, it appears here to be without ulterior symbolic meaning; the purpose is to give the maximum reality to the events of the story	REMBRANDT Harmenszoon van Rijn	Tobit Accusing Anna of Stealing the Kid	Oil on panel, 40 x 30 cm	1626	religious	Dutch	1601-1650

34656-louvre2.jpg	Hubert Robert painted many views, both real and imaginary, of the Grande Galerie of the Louvre. His imaginary vies really constitute a set of designs for an ideal museum. When he painted this picture (the finest in the series) in 1796, the Galley was nothing but an interminably long corridor, lit only by side windows, which linked the Louvre to the Tuileries. The architects who were later responsible for the lighting and redecoration of the Grande Galerie were merely executing the original ideas of Hubert Robert. In this painting several of the masterpieces of the Museum Central can be recognized, notably Raphael's Holy Family of François I and Titian's Entombment	ROBERT, Hubert	Design for the Grande Galerie in the Louvre	Oil on canvas, 112 x 143 cm	1796	interior	French	1751-1800
00849-35_eucha.jpg	This is the fresco on the wall of Cell 35 of the Convento di San Marco in Florence.In contrast to most frescoes in the cells of the friars and novices, those in the corridor of the lay brethren are illustrative narratives that closely follow the Gospel of Matthew. These portrayals were directed to a community that was less attuned to theological and visual abstraction. Many of the scenes are situated in mountainous landscapes or detailed architectural settings. The Institute of the Eucharist in Cell 35 underscored the Dominicans devotion to the Eucharist, which St Thomas articulated most eloquently in composing the office for the feast of Corpus Domini. It transpires in a spacious room similar to the convent's actual refectory and repeats elements of San Marco's own architecture - the arched windows of the dormitory, the well in the second cloister - to emphasize its relevance to the lay brother.This fresco was executed by an assistant of Fra Angelico	ANGELICO, Fra	Institution of the Eucharist (Cell 35)	Fresco, 186 x 234 cm	1441-42	religious	Italian	1401-1450

04577-pendant1.jpg	"A child teasing a cat is a frequent subject in Dutch art; it refers to the idea that (sexual) teasing can lead to a painful scratching. That this mischievous girl is partially disrobed makes the consequences more obvious and erotic-since her bared skin teases the viewer as well. Her voluptuousness and apparent cheerfulness suggest a brothel, not the everyday life of children.Van Bijlert, a leading master in Utrecht, owes his sensual treatment of the human body to the influence of his teacher Abraham Bloemaert and the paintings by the great Italian master Caravaggio that he saw while in Rome (1621-24/25), such as the latter's melancholic, starkly sensual The Musicians,"" from which he apparently adapted the shoulder and arm of the boy at the right"	BIJLERT, Jan van	Girl Teasing a Cat	Oil on panel, 42 x 33 cm	c. 1630	genre	Dutch	1601-1650

38442-10szinye.jpg	"The artist never accepted commissions to paint portraits; all the portraits he painted featured members of his family. These representations, each of which is a pearl of intimate Realism, reach the soul of the model. Szinyei began to paint portraits of this wife on several occasions, but he was not always able to finish them, because his wife, in sharp contrast with Szinyei's contemplating character, was ever so busy that she had difficulty tolerating the modelling sessions. She set both for the famous ""Woman in Lilac Dress"" (1874) and for the ""Portrait in Shawl"". The latter portrait was not finished in 1880: the deep scarlet coloured velvet dress his wife is shown wearing was completed only around 1890, long after the couple's divorce in 1887. (In actual fact Szinyei's daughter was sitting as model.) The painting is dominated by the delicate and sensitive beauty of the model's face, radiating from the background of warm colours. In Szinye's pictures, the women are often shown wearing in their hair or on their hats colourful flowers, or as in the case of ""Portrait in Shawl"", laces and ribbons. We can almost be certain that he did not use them just to conform with the fashion of the age.

The lavish fabrics are complemented by the expensive instruments: in addition to the violin and lute, a bass violin rests against the bench in the foreground while a shawm, the ancestor of the oboe, lies just above it. Costly music books are also heaped beside the figures. The murky, grayish-brown background of this ambiguous, lapidary setting also contains a large ewer and expansive curtain whose knots and folds echo the fabric encasing the lutenist. The emphasis here is upon luxury.	BEGA, Cornelis	The Duet	Oil on panel, 45 x 41 cm	1663	genre	Dutch	1651-1700

39747-12wisdom.jpg	Throughout his period of service to King Philip II, Titian continued to be regarded as the premier painter of the Venetian Republic.

01103-manportr.jpg	The painting is one of the portraits which were famed for their realism. Due to his knowledge of Flemish pictures, the painter had made a decisive contribution to the spreading and perfection in Italy of what was at that time the new medium of oil painting, and normally depicted figures in three quarter life-size as statue-like half-length portraits in front of a barrier. As in this portrait, the face is particularly emphasized by the dark background and simple headgear, with the eyes directed straight at the observer	ANTONELLO da Messina	Portrait of a Man	Oil on wood, 32 x 26 cm	1474	portrait	Italian	1451-1500

29410-bonnier.jpg	Joseph Bonnier de la Mosson (1702-1744) was the scion of a family of well-to-do cloth merchants from the southern French city of Montpellier. He served as an officer in the French royal army until the death of his father in 1726. He was a polymath who prided himself on his knowledge of literature, music, and the sciences. He died unexpectedly on July 26, 1744.Nattier began Bonnier's portrait in early 1744, the year of the sitter's death; he signed and dated the canvas the following year. The portrait has few rivals in French portraiture of the time, not only for the elegance of its composition and the refinement of its colouring, but also for its vivid delineation of character	NATTIER, Jean-Marc	Joseph Bonnier de la Mosson	Oil on canvas, 138 x 105 cm	1745	portrait	French	1701-1750

11128-early19.jpg	Many of Degas's drawings and studies of movement after 1860 are inspired by race-course scenes.

12493-08lotdau.jpg	This delightfully spontaneous panel depicts Lot and his two daughters fleeing from the destruction of Sodom. In the story from Genesis, two angels warn Lot that he should escape before God destroys the city for its sins. Lot is told that his family must not look back, otherwise they will be turned into pillars of salt.In Dürer's panel, Lot leads the way, dressed in a warm fur-lined coat and a magnificent turban. He carries a basket of eggs and has a flask of wine slung over his shoulder on his stick. His two daughters follow several paces behind, one bearing a bundle on her head and the other with an elegant casket and a distaff and yarn. Far behind them, near the towering rocks, is Lot's wife, transformed into a brown pillar of salt. In the distance the town of Sodom explodes with brimstone and fire, huge columns of smoke belching up into the sky. Gomorrah, in the far distance, suffers a similar fate.This depiction of Lot's flight is not the main picture, but the reverse of a panel of the Virgin and Child. The two sides are quite different, not only in subject-matter but also in style. The Lot panel is painted in a loose, spontaneous manner, whereas the Virgin and Child is much more finely worked. However, Dürer must have intended them to be seen together. The panel was painted for the Nuremberg merchant family of Haller, whose arms appear in the bottom left corner of the panel of the Virgin.Virgin and Child at a Window was long assumed to be the work of the Venetian artist Giovanni Bellini, because of its composition and colouring. In 1934 it was identified as a Dürer, painted about three years after his return from Venice. It was bought by Baron Heinrich von Thyssen-Bornemisza, who owned it until 1950	DÜRER, Albrecht	Lot Fleeing with his Daughters from Sodom	Oil and tempera on panel, 52 x 41 cm	c. 1498	religious	German	1501-1550
18370-1605grec.jpg	In collaboration with his son Jorge Manuel in 1603-07, El Greco executed an extensive programme of pictures for the Hospital de la Caridad in Illescas: a Madonna of Charity, a Coronation of the Virgin, an Annunciation, and a Nativity. Under a separate contract a further picture was made, of St Ildefonso, who was particularly important for Toledo. The painting is in the side altar on the left of the main chapel of the church, balancing the Virgin of Charity. Its original place in the church is not known. The painting is not mentioned in the incomplete documentation for the decoration of the chapel, and if, as is probable, it was not painted at the same time, it cannot date much before June 1603, the date of the contract, and was more likely painted soon after the conclusion of litigation in August 1607. In its present position, it makes a grand pair to the Virgin of Charity, and is one of the most splendid of his 'portraits' of Saints.It is difficult, and perhaps not proper, to separate his portraits of Saints from his actual portraits. In both he employs all his means of spiritual or psychological expression. The legend is that Saint Ildefonso, the first Bishop of Toledo, presented an image of the Virgin of the Mantle to a foundation of his in Illescas. The Saint is portrayed before the same image, as he wrote his dissertation on the Purity of the Virgin. The state of inspiration is brilliantly expressed. There is an infinite distinction in expression between the hand poised with the pen in this 'portrait' and the similar motif in the portrait of his son.In his depiction of St Ildefonso, El Greco anticipated a Baroque motif, that of the learned churchman. As if receiving inspiration, the saint is seated at a desk covered with an array of utensils that is unusually detailed for the artist.There is a smaller replica of the picture in the National Gallery of Art in Washington. It belonged once to the painter Jean François Millet, and later to Edgar Degas	GRECO, El	St Ildefonso	Oil on canvas, 187 x 102 cm	1603-05	religious	Spanish	1551-1600
11143-1870s_08.jpg	From 1870 Degas increasingly painted ballet subjects. First he painted a series of ballet rehearsal pictures. The Foyer of the Opera at Rue Le Peletier shows ten ballerinas being examined in the great hall. The white-clad Louis François Mérante, instructor at the opera house, is giving orders which the dancers have to follow. Those who are not busy exercising are watching the ballerina currently being examined with close attention. The work is organized around the polarity of group and single figure. The scene, remarkable for the rigour of its composition, has a distinctive energy centre in the vacant chair at the fore	DEGAS, Edgar	The Foyer of the Opera at Rue Le Peletier	Oil on canvas, 32 x 46 cm	1872	other	French	1851-1900

14327-scene04.jpg	Scene 4 of the Cecilia cycle in the Oratory of St Cecilia, painted by an unidentified collaborator of Francesco Francia, shows the angel, now visible to Valerian as well, placing wreath of flowers from paradise on the heads of the bride and groom. The angels offers to grant Valerian one wish, and Valerian asks that his brother Tiburtius might also convert to Christianity. The scene to the left in the middle distance depicts the discussion between Valerian, Tiburtius, and Cecilia about Christ's Passion and his earthly succession - a discussion that took place before Tiburtius received baptism. To the right in the background the brother has sought out the pope as well, and is saved	FRANCIA, Francesco	Legend of Sts Cecilia and Valerian, Scene 4	Fresco	1504-06	religious	Italian	1501-1550
16602-stucco.jpg	For the decoration of the loggia, Raphael devised the scheme and provided the compositions for the narratives, while the actual work was delegated to the most senior assistants. Giulio Romano took charge of the figurative scenes with Gianfrancesco Penni collaborating on the preparation of the cartoons and Giovanni da Udine as overseer of the decorative areas. As part of the decorative scheme, there is a series of reliefs on the pilasters.

34219-s_onufri.jpg	Ribera studied in Francisco Ribalta's workshop in Valencia, but when still young he went to Naples, then under Spanish rule, where he worked for the rest of his life. He was called there as Lo Spagnoletto. He obtained most of his commissions from the Spanish Viceroy and his entourage, but he also completed a good many paintings for the churches of the city.The influence of Caravaggio was felt throughout southern Italy and there can be little doubt that Ribera was the artist with the strongest and most independent personality of all his followers. Ribera represented crude reality boldly and without embellishment. The construction of his pictures is monumental and he reveals a strong sense of drama, empahasized by means of strongly contrasting light and shade. The poor inhabitants of Naples and the peasants of southern Italy were his models, and he depicted them without flattery or idealization as enormous figures clothed in rags. The painting of Saint Onufri also shows the influence of Caravaggio	RIBERA, Jusepe de	Saint Onufri	Oil on canvas, 130 x 104 cm	1637	religious	Spanish	1601-1650
20797-virgin_c.jpg	The composition of this remarkably refined little painting is based on a lost small work by Memling, which is best reflected in the Virgin of the Metropolitan Museum, New York. Since the dimensions correspond, the work must have been done with a tracing or punch-cardboard based on the original. The version discussed here shows the image in the right direction. The Virgin is represented high above a landscape, more monumental than the prototype. She stands behind a wall over which a white cloth is draped with very heavy folds. This also differs from the model. The panel was incorrectly ascribed to Michel Sittow, and later attributed to Juan de Flandes in 1966. On account of the quality, the typical facial features and the vaporous green-grey landscape, this attribution cannot be doubted. The panel originated about the time of the Retablo Mayor of Palencia (c. 1510) and may have been the central panel of a small triptych described in the accounts of Palencia Cathedral as the 'tabla oratorio de tress pieças'. If so, it could have been a work in the style of Memling's Triptych of Benedetto Portinari (Florence, Galleria degli Uffizi), with a donor and a saint in front of a continuous landscape on the wings	JUAN DE FLANDES	Virgin and Child before a Landscape	Oil on panel, 26 x 19,5 cm	c. 1510	religious	Spanish	1501-1550

31940-03josep3.jpg	The painting belongs to the series of four entitled Scenes from the Life of Joseph the Hebrew, now in the National Gallery, London. These works, together with others by Andrea del Sarto, Francesco Granacci, Bachiacca and Franciabigio, were intended for the decoration of the nuptial chamber of Francesco Borgherini and Margherita Acciaioli, who married in 1515. The group of fourteen paintings, broken up at the end of the 16th century, was contained within a wooden decoration made by Baccio d'Agnolo.In this panel the thesis proposed by Mannerism is fully elaborated: the painter is no longer to be bound by perspective, or by the necessity of presenting his subject in a rational, objective manner. He may use light and colour, chiaroscuro and proportion as he pleases; he may borrow from any source he chooses; the only obligation upon him is to create an interesting design, expressive of the ideas inherent in the subject, and the various parts need bear no relationship to each other. The colour must be evocative and beautiful in itself.This work, traditionally entitled Joseph in Egypt, depicts the most significant episodes of Joseph reuniting with his family of origin. The painting is divided into four distinct zones. In the left foreground Joseph presents his family, who he invited to move to Egypt, to the pharaoh; according to Vasari, the boy with dark cloak and brown tunic sitting on the first step of the stairs on which the figures are arranged, is a portrait of the young Bronzino. On the right, Joseph is seen sitting on a triumphal cart pulled by three putti; hoisting himself up with his left arm and clutching firmly onto a putto with the other, he bends toward a kneeling figure who is presenting him a petition or reading him a message; a fifth putto, wrapped in a piece of cloth blown by the wind, dominates the scene from the top of a column, appearing to mime the gesture of one of the two half-living statues represented in the top left and centre of the painting. A restless crowd, curious to see what is going on, throngs the adjacent space between the two buildings in the background. Other mysterious figures, resting against one of the large boulders that dominate the landscape, turn their attention toward the action in the foreground.The clothes, expressions and features of all these figures are inspired by northern European painting, as is the large castle and surrounding trees depicted in the background. On the unrailed staircase of the imposing cylindrical building to the right, Joseph takes one of his children by the hand; higher up, the other is greeted affectionately by his mother. Lastly, Joseph and his sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, are portrayed inside the room at the top of the building, where Jacob, now old and near to death, imparts his paternal blessing. The curious combination of all these elements confers to the painting an anomalous and intriguing quality	PONTORMO, Jacopo	Joseph in Egypt	Oil on wood, 96 x 109 cm	1515-18	religious	Italian	1501-1550
43591-9marymag.jpg	This painting, formerly given to Pomarancio, has been reattributed to Simon Vouet. It may perhaps be identifiable with the Magdalene cited with an attribution to Sacchi in the 1648-49 inventory of the Palazzo Barberini at Monterotondo.The painting, which shows some stylistic and typological connections with the Vouet's David in Palazzo Bianco in Genoa, could date from the years (c. 1623-27) in which the French artist was in close contact with the Barberini, ending with his departure for France. Though the canvas is certainly rich in Caravaggesque qualities, Vouet is already showing himself as a full participant in the new classicism that was on the rise in the Roman art scene. At the same time he also shows signs of sympathy with the first fully baroque works that were being created in Rome.This painting poses interesting problems on account of its close compositional connections to the Magdalene by Guido Reni, dated to 1631-32 (also in the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica, Rome). The cut of the scene anticipates the composition that Vouet adopted for his Portrait of Gaucher de Chatillon (Louvre, Paris), carried out for the Palace of Cardinal Richelieu between 1633 and 1634. Dominated by the monumental figure of the Magdalene, the picture opens out to a luxuriant perspectival landscape view in the left background. Another highly interesting element is the close stylistic analogy between the Magdalene and Vouet's Allegory of Peace, that was also in the Barberini collection (also in the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica, Rome). As the Allegory has been attributed to an anonymous brother of the Cavalier Muti (a student of Vouet and Claude Mellan), the similarities between the two pictures lead to basic questions about the true authorship of this extraordinary painting	VOUET, Simon	St Mary Magdalene	Oil on canvas, 241 x 171 cm	1623-27	religious	French	1601-1650
26364-corsini.jpg	The picture shows the ceiling fresco in the reading room of the library of the Accademia dei Lincei in the Palazzo Corsini.The shape of the frame alludes to Pietro da Cortona's ceiling in Santa Maria in Vallicella. This frame, especially characteristic of Rome, was popular both in sacred and secular contexts, and was also frequently used in horizontal-format compositions. The ceiling in the library of Palazzo Corsini, painted by the Florentine Vincenzo Meucci, is a good example. Befitting the stature of the Corsini family, which supplied a pope in Clement XII, the pictorial program combines motifs alluding to the function of the library (church fathers and scholars) with the personification of Ecclesia, angels, putti, virtues, and vanquished vices	MEUCCI, Vincenzo	Ceiling decoration	Fresco	c. 1747	mythological	Italian	1701-1750

38938-02gesuat.jpg	The fresco is the largest version of this subject in European art, and it combines two different iconographic traditions: in the upper part of the picture, the Rosenkranzbild, in which Mary gives the Rosary to mankind, and, in the lower part, a depiction of the beneficence of the Rosary on earth, represented by St Dominic. As well as the Madonna of the Rosary, the fresco also extols St Dominic, the founder of the Dominican order, to whom the dog is a reference (lat. domini canes, God's hounds). All manner of people are portrayed - represented among others by the Doge, a Turk, a nun, and a mother and child, a symbol of Christian charity - so that the viewer, whether rich or poor, could identify with them	TIEPOLO, Giovanni Battista	The Institution of the Rosary	Fresco, 1200 x 450 cm	1737-39	religious	Italian	1701-1750

21312-03sebast.jpg	There is a group of painting attributed to Georges de La Tour depicting St Sebastian and St Irene. Part of them is a horizontal composition where the model of one of the figures is a familiar La Tour type. Most of the versions are curiously incompetent, only three of them having pretensions to quality. The upright versions of the same subject (one in the Louvre and the other in Berlin) are more celebrated. The composition is monumental, as if the painting were depicting a sculptured tableau.The Louvre composition is especially moving, with the mourning figure in a blue cowl (in the Berlin version the cowl is black) looking as if she were taken from a piece of Burgundian tomb sculpture. Recent observations on the possible dating of the costumes have left little doubt that the picture is rather later than the artist's lifetime. Étienne de La Tour, the son of the artist was suggested (but not accepted) as the possible author. Étienne de La Tour is actually documented as being required to continue his father's style, should the latter die inopportunately, and it is likely that he continued long into the 1660s and even the 1670s, painting ever-weaker versions of his father's work which eventually became mockeries of his father's genius	LA TOUR, Georges de	St Sebastien Attended by St Irene	Oil on canvas, 167 x 130 cm	c. 1649	religious	French	1601-1650
30613-2mira11.jpg	Toward the end of the seventeenth century, Cesare Alessandri, a wealthy Venetian merchant had a wing erected to the side of his villa, to be used as foresteria (guest quarters). Decorations embellish three rooms on the second floor; the paintings in the central hall and in the northwest room are attributed to Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini. The fresco cycles in these two rooms constitute the first private fresco commission given to Pellegrini after his return to Venice from Rome. His stay in Rome had been beneficial to his development, enabling him to incorporate into his own visual repertory the language of Luca Giordano and Baciccio.The frescoes that adorn the northwest room, with the scene Hannibal Swearing his Hatred of the Romans, one can detect a certain stiffening of the figures compared to the rendering of those in the central hall. This may be the fault of the faux architecture, which is rather cumbersome, out of proportion	PELLEGRINI, Giovanni Antonio	View of the northwest room in the foresteria	Fresco	c. 1704	interior	Italian	1701-1750
32256-08triump.jpg	The Triumph of Pan was one of several paintings commissioned from Poussin, in 1636 the leading French artist in Rome, by Cardinal Richelieu. They were intended for a room in his ch&#226;teau in Poitou which would also house mythological pictures by Mantegna, Perugino and Costa. Poussin must have been advised about the scale not only of the canvases but also of the figures, for although he never saw the Renaissance paintings his personages are much the same size as theirs. He must also have been told that the pictures were to be set above a high dado, divided by gilt caryatids, gold fleur-de-lys against a blue ground, and marine battles, all under a gilt ceiling.The Cabinet de la Chambre du Roy in Richelieu's ch&#226;teau celebrated the cardinal's 'gift' to Louis XIII of mastery of the seas. The room, with its 'Combat of Wealth and Art', as a contemporary panegyric puts it, and furnished in addition to paintings and panelling with porphyry vases and ancient busts, must have presented a formidable challenge to Poussin. Not only would he be competing with some of the foremost Italian Renaissance artists, his pictures also had to contend with the glittering décor - hence the colours here are among the most brilliant he ever lavished on a painting. Sadly, the room was dismantled long ago and the pictures dispersed, so we can judge the full effect only in our mind's eye.Poussin carefully allowed for the spectator's point of view. Nimble visitors to the Gallery can sit on the floor to look at this picture in order better to appreciate its spatial construction, and thus its full significance. The revellers occupy a raised stage extending back to where rocks and vine-hung trees screen off the backdrop of sky and distant mountains. Propped up vertically against this earthen stage are a timbrel and two masks - an ancient satyr mask and a modern Italian Columbine. Behind them a Punchinello mask joins a still life drawn from the imagery of ancient bacchanals: thyrsoi - staffs wreathed with ivy and surmounted by pine cones - the crooked stick and pipes of Pan, wine in a metal bowl or crater, and a Greek wine jar showing the god Dionysus, the Roman Bacchus.The composition is indebted to an engraving after Giulio Romano, a pupil of Raphael, but Poussin also demonstrates his first-hand access to antiquarian lore. The mixture of modern and ancient masks, and the stage-like construction, allude to the origins of theatre in bacchic rites. The main scene represents the 'triumph' or worship of the armless bust of a horned deity mounted on a pillar, his face smeared red with the juice of boiled ivy stems. This is the 'term' of Pan, Arcadian god of shepherds and herdsmen, and Priapus, a phallic god of fertility, protector of gardens, whose cult was imported into Greece from the Near East. Confused with each other, both were associated with Dionysus/Bacchus: Dionysus, god of the grape-vine, who died, descended into Hades then rose again was himself identified with seasonal decay and rebirth. All the participants are members of his entourage (as we find them in Titian's Bacchus and Ariadne): nymphs and their lewd playmates the satyrs; maenads who rend deer limb from limb or strew flowers from the winnowing basket sacred to Dionysus. A world of pagan imaginings is brought to life in all its cruel and seductive charm, without a hint of anachronistic moralising	POUSSIN, Nicolas	The Triumph of Pan	Oil on canvas, 134 x 145 cm	1636	mythological	French	1601-1650
24924-metropo1.jpg	This double-sided panel shows on one side the martyrdom of St Lawrence and on the other a woman offering drink to a bedridden man. The work is a fragment of an altarpiece shutter, in which the St Lawrence scene on gold ground would have been oriented to the interior, visible in the altarpiece's open state.Three other double-sided panels were recognized as part of the same altarpiece. These panels also depict acts of mercy on the exterior, namely Beheading of John the Baptist (interior) and Providing Shelter to Strangers (exterior) and Feast of Herod (interior) and Feeding the Hungry (exterior), both panels in the Stadtmuseum Simeonstift, Trier, as well as St Lawrence before the Emperor (interior) and Clothing the Naked (exterior) in a private collection. The dismantled altarpiece was attributed to an unknown master in Salzburg named after this ensemble as Master of the Acts of Mercy.A plausible reconstruction assumes a total of six acts of mercy, and arranges the wing scenes in two tall columns, displaying the Acts of Mercy in the closed state, and three scenes each from the lives of St John the Baptist and St Lawrence in the open state. It is suggested that two missing acts, tending the sick and visiting the imprisoned were shown at the top of the wings. The centre of the altarpiece was probably a painted or a sculpted shrine	MASTER of the Acts of Mercy	Martyrdom of St Lawrence (interior)	Oil on fir panel, 74 x 47 cm	1460s	religious	Austrian	1451-1500

06024-6joseph.jpg	This painting has a pendant, Jacob punishing Joseph (private collection)made by Nicolaes de Helt Stockade in the same year, 1655. It is unclear how De Bray and De Helt Stockade came to make pendants; the partnership may have ben brought about by an Amsterdam client.De Brays picture illustrates one of the last episodes of the Old Testament story of Joseph, in which it transpires that his father's interpretation of the dream was correct. The elderly Jacob, who reached the age of 130, took his family to Egypt to see his son Joseph, viceroy to the pharaoh, for the last time in his life. He had sent another son, Judah, to announce the family's arrival. Joseph prepared his chariot at once and set off to meet Jacob in Goshen. On seeing his father he embraced him and wept.In the painting, Jacob's entire family bows down before Joseph, who stands on the right guarded by soldiers with halberds. The chariot in which he rode to meet his father - depicted here as a seventeenth-century carriage - is visible in the background. On the left we see Jacob, his first wife Leah (Rachel, Joseph's mother was no longer alive) and Joseph's brothers. The small dog with the dog in the left foreground could be Jacob's youngest son, Benjamin.The composition of the painting corresponds closely to two drawings, both of which, like the painting, date from 1655.

Christ is standing in a stone sarcophagus, displaying his stigmata. In front of him lie the instruments of his Passion, the crown of thorns and nails.

19452-eucharis.jpg	Religious flower still-lifes are a special category, first developed by the Fleming Daniel Seghers, a pupil of Jan Brueghel the Elder. While Dutch paintings of flowers, particularly tulips, clearly showed a tendency towards secularization (with noticeable emphasis on the economic and aesthetic value of flowers rather than their religious significance, Seghers tried to recover their spiritual symbolism, in accordance with the counter-reformational aims the Jesuit order.Apart from the Virgin Mary, Seghers and his pupils had a preference for Eucharistic motifs. They particularly enjoyed painting arrangements of garlands around a niche in a wall in brown hues, showing a communion chalice with a host suspended above it. The host has a mysterious luminescent quality which emphasized the process of transubtantiation (the changing of bread and wine into the body and blood of Jesus). This subject was painted especially frequently by Jan Davidsz. de Heem, who was born in Utrecht but spent a considerable amount of time in Antwerp.Like Seghers, de Heem succeeded in adding a phosphorescent luminosity to his garlands, which also have an enamel-like clarity about them and richly colourful nuances. In his Eucharistic motifs they consist of fruit - particularly grapes - and bundles of grain, as well as apples, pears, figs and maize. The human eye can hardly appreciate the infinitely delicate precision of the tender, thread-like stems and little twigs winding around the jumble of the painstakingly detailed fruits. The Eucharist had a particularly prominent place in the Catholic Counter-Reformation, as a response to the Protestant doctrine that bread and wine merely had a symbolic value during communion	HEEM, Jan Davidsz. de	Eucharist in Fruit Wreath	Oil on canvas, 138 x 125,5 cm	1648	still-life	Dutch	1601-1650

The predella depicted scenes from the legend of St Michael.Most unusually, in these panels Beccafumi has abandoned the oil he used for the altarpiece for the old-fashioned, less flexible medium of tempera.

19786-dianacal.jpg	The mythological subject of this painting is taken from Ovid's Metamorphoses. Diana's nymphs were expected to be as chaste as the goddess herself. One of them, Callisto, was seduced by Jupiter who first disguised himself as Diana in order to gain the nymphs presence. In Diana and Callisto, the unfortunate Callisto is shown being stripped by her companions at the command of the chaste goddess Diana to reveal her pregnancy. Banished for her shameful state, Callisto was transformed into a bear by Jupiter's jealous wife Juno, but was later immortalised by him as the constellation of the Great Bear.Hoet's refined technique is visible in his delicate style of painting and bears resemblance to the Leiden fijnschilders of the period. Although the size of the Colnaghi-Bernheimer painting is relatively small, Hoet manages to create a lively interaction between the figures and their setting and the composition is supplemented by Italianate architectural ruins which are visible in the background	HOET, Gerard I	Diana and Callisto	Oil on copper, 35 x 45 cm	c. 1710	mythological	Dutch	1651-1700

19311-material.jpg	William Harnett developed the trompe-l'oeil technique in American painting This early work shows the style and technique which made him popular. Using a carefully arranged and balanced composition he creates a seemingly casual image: a table  bearing a number of domestic objects. The attention to detail with which he captures each object and its textures and reflections is combined with the sense of immediacy and instantaneity conferred by the pipe smoke, the burning matches and the breadcrumbs scattered on the table	HARNETT, William Michael	Materials for a Leisure Hour	Oil on canvas, 38 x 52 cm	1879	still-life	American	1851-1900

Renoir appeared, and, attracted by the atmosphere, decided to paint the same subject as painted by Manet, Camille Monet and Her Son in Their Garden.It is interesting to compare the two works painted that day. We see that Manet's painting seems both more carefully thought out and more ambitious than Renoir's. Manet remains allusive, lacking the spontaneity shown by Renoir.

She refused him and although he kept his word, he denied her perpetual youth, so she was commanded to centuries as a wizened crone.In the painting the Sibyl, a young woman is shown standing before the sitting Apollo holding out her cupped hand which contains the heap of dust	CERRINI, Giovanni Domenico	Apollo and the Cumaean Sibyl	Oil on canvas, 102 x 135 cm	-	mythological	Italian	1601-1650

13335-1open.jpg	"The most famous work of Jan van Eyck is a huge Ghent Altarpiece with many scenes in the city of Ghent. It is said to have been begun by Jan's elder brother Hubert, of whom little is known, and was completed by Jan in 1432. On the frame a quatrain is inscribed which states that the polyptych was begun by Pictor Hubertus Eyck, and finished by his brother Jan, at the request of Jodocus Vijd, deputy burgomaster of Ghent, warden of the church of St John, and of his wife, Elisabeth Borluut, who commissioned it. The verse was placed there when the altarpiece was installed on 6 May 1432.The stylistic analysis reveals that in the painting the work of two different hands can be clearly discerned. The overall conception of the altarpiece is the work of Hubert, along with the execution of certain parts, such as the panels in the lower tier. Here, the manner is archaic, and reflects the continuing dominance of the international style that was practised by Broederlam. The composition is typically unoriginal: the landscape is still conceived as a distant background, with which the figures at the front have no organic relation, an effect that is reinforced by the bird's eye point of view.This polyptych is mystical, not to say esoteric, in intention, and is imbued throughout with both spiritual and intellectual signification. When opened, it represents the communion of saints, which is ""the new heaven and the new earth"", in the words of the Revelation of St John. Thus the central panel of the lower tier portrays the saints symbolizing the eight Beatitudes gathered round the altar where the sacrifice of the Lamb is taking place, at the centre of the heavenly garden which has sprung from His blood.To left and right, in the foreground, are two processions facing one another. One of these is made up of the Old Testament patriarchs and prophets, and the other of figures from the New Testament. Some of them are kneeling, barefoot. Behind them is assembled the hierarchy of the Church - popes, deacons and bishops, wearing sumptuous jewelry and clothes in the bright red of martyrdom. In the background are two further groups, facing each other as if they had just emerged from the surrounding shrubbery. These are, on one side, the Confessors of the Faith, tightly packed together and almost all dressed in blue; and on the other side, the Virgin Martyrs, holding out palm fronds and wearing in their hair crowns of flowers of a kind traditionally worn by young girls at certain holy ceremonies. In the middle of the panel, around the altar where the Lamb spills forth his blood, angels kneel, holding the emblems of His Passion. Grace is symbolized by a radiant dove hovering in the sky, and eternal life is represented by a fountain in the foreground. A paradisiacal landscape runs across all five lower panels, uniting them in a single composition. It is strewn with plants from different countries and flowers of different seasons. The central panel is vibrant with green, while those to the sides are more arid and rocky. The horizon sits high in the frame and is closed off by groves of trees, behind which clusters of fairy-tale buildings can be made out, representing the heavenly Jerusalem.The community of saints also extends onto the side panels. Magnificently arrayed horsemen, representing the Soldiers of Christ, are followed by the Just Judges. Opposite them are the Holy Hermits who have renounced the world, and the Pilgrim Saints, who were favourite figures of identification throughout the Middle Ages. They are led by a giant of a man, St Christopher. Many later commentators have suggested that his great height would have reminded the contemporary viewer of Jodocus Vijd's brother, also called Christopher. In the middle of the upper tier is God Almighty, the Word, essence and origin of the universe. He is dressed in red and is crowned with a magnificent tiara. On his left is Mary and on his right, St John the Baptist. These central figures are surrounded by angels who are singing or playing instruments. At the far right and left of the composition respectively are the figures of Adam and Eve. They were painted by Jan Van Eyck, and are set into trompe-l'oeil niches. Light and shadow play delicately over their forms which stand out as though they had been sculpted in the round."

05690-shepdrea.jpg	"Pastoral scenes - so-called pastorale - were typical of French painting under Louis XV. They developed from the ""f&#234;tes galantes"" of Antoine Watteau, who depicted courtiers disporting themselves in park-like landscapes, and from the ""f&#234;tes champ&#234;tres"" - the rural festivals of Jean-Baptiste Pater, who combined court and country life.

21490-s_ursula.jpg	Painted by Lanfranco at the commission of Giacomo Simonelli, this painting decorated Simonelli's family chapel which was dedicated to Saint Ursula. In 1630 the church, Santa Marta in Vaticano, was destroyed to clear space for the construction of the Vatican's Palazzo del Governatorato. A date of 1622 was proposed for the picture on the basis of stylistic analogies with Lanfranco's Saint Margherita of Cortona, signed and dated by the artist in 1622 (Galleria Palatina, Palazzo Pitti, Florence). The Saint Ursula does not belong to the most refined and elegant phase of Lanfranco's career (1618-20), but rather to a slightly later phase of around 1622-24. This protobaroque period for Lanfranco is characterized by a more robust and vigorous style that is a prelude to the artist's full baroque work of 1624-25.In the same years Lanfranco also carried out another work for the Simonelli family at Santa Marta, an altarpiece similar in typology and style to the Saint Ursula. Showing the Virgin and Child and Saints James and Anthony Abbot, the painting is now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna	LANFRANCO, Giovanni	St Ursula and the Virgins	Oil on canvas, 209 x 138	1622	religious	Italian	1601-1650
32783-23connes.jpg	Before his arrival in Florence, Raphael had already had occasion to compose small-scale devotional icons of the Madonna and Child, linked to a taste for the versions created by Perugino. An interesting sequence of this type can be seen in several examples, all from around 1502 to 1504, built on the motif of the Madonna holding a book. They are known as the Solly Madonna (in Berlin), the Norton Simon Madonna (in California) and the Conestabile Madonna (in St. Petersburg).The painting was a gift of the Conestabile family of Perugia to the Russian tzaress in 1871. When transferring to canvas at the end of the last century it was discovered that originally instead of the book there was a pomegranate in the hands of the Madonna. The landscape of the background with snow-capped peaks deserves a particular attention.Raphael met the challenge of creating a round composition when he painted this delicate Madonna. He provides a stable structure for the round picture by means of the vertical figure of the Madonna and the horizontal lines of the landscape. The Madonna's head is gently inclined and the contour of her left hand flows rhythmically into the outline of the Christ Child's body, thus responding to the circular form	RAFFAELLO Sanzio	Madonna with the Book (Conestabile Madonna)	Tempera on canvas transferred from wood, diameter 17,9 cm	1504	religious	Italian	1501-1550
28922-port_sol.jpg	Moroni was one of the most accomplished portraitists in Lombard painting in the 16th century. For a long time he did not obtain the recognition he deserved, because some of his best portraits were attributed to Titian. His teacher was Moretto da Brescia (Alessandro Bonvicino), like-wise a skilled portraitist. There is no documented evidence of Moroni ever having visited Venice, but his oeuvre demonstrates that he was familiar with the work being done there	MORONI, Giovanni Battista	Portrait of a Soldier	Oil on canvas, 119 x 91 cm	1555-59	portrait	Italian	1551-1600

16367-wall.jpg	The decorative bands on the walls above contain several scenes from the Old Testament and busts of saints and prophets. The Old Testament scenes are of a very modest standard, and owe their presence in the chapel to the Gothic tradition of representing parallels between the Old and New Testament.

27171-i_landsc.jpg	Under Louis XIV, the two main landscape painter of the time were Pierre Patel and Francisque Millet. They were largely derivative in their styles, but this was the secret of their success. Both of them are relatively little known today.Francisque Millet was more talented than Patel, though his present reputation is also obscure. Flemish in origin like Philippe de Champaigne, he worked mainly in Paris, specializing in classical landscapes inspired by the works of Dughet and Poussin. Millet had imagination and good powers of observation, but he never painted anything without a classical format. Millet preferred an intense blue for his landscapes (as did Poussin), which gives then an unnatural air.The ideal landscape in Budapest characterizes well the style of this French painter of Flemish origin	MILLET, Francisque	Imaginary Landscape	Oil on canvas, 57 x 66,5 cm	1660s	landscape	French	1651-1700
15485-1donor.jpg	"""In two pictures on either side he painted Francesco Sassetti kneeling, and Madonna Nera, his wife and her children, the latter being in the scene above where the boy is raised to life, with some beautiful maidens of the same family"" (Vasari).The two donors are in prayer on either side of the altar, as if they are taking part in the Adoration of the Shepherds depicted on the altarpiece. Linking the frescoes and the central panel painting in this way, Ghirlandaio creates what is almost a triptych. Astonishingly enough, the wife, Nera Corsi Sassetti, is occupying the traditionally more distinguished position on the right of the religious scene.At the base is the painted inscription: A.D. MCCCCLXXX. XV decembris. This could be the initial date of the work whose conclusion is in the great altarpiece with the Nativity, dated 1485"	GHIRLANDAIO, Domenico	Portrait of the Donor Nera Corsi Sassetti	Fresco	1483-85	portrait	Italian	1451-1500
39646-4vendra.jpg	Returning to Venice from Rome in 1546 Titian created a remarkable group portrait of the male members of the Vendramin. Here he domesticizes official work such as Bellini's votive portrait of Doge Agostino Barbarigo as well as frescoes he had seen in the papal apartments in Rome. While the painting has the look of an impromptu gathering, it is rooted  in prestigious models that betray political motives on the part of Titian and the Vendramin.Titian adapted elements such as the steps, massive altar and flickering candles from Raphael's Mass of Bolsena as a suitably impressive setting for the Vendramin family's adoration of a reliquary of a fragment of the True Cross. Although the relic was owned by the Scuola Grande di San Giovanni Evangelista, the Vendramin family was closely associated with it: one of their ancestors had donated the relic to the Scuola, and an Andrea Vendramin, namesake of Titian's patron, was famous for having rescued it when it fell into a canal. Titian suggests the intimacy of the family's relation to the relic by placing the current head of family (also named Andrea) in the centre of the composition, with one hand on the altar as he looks out of the picture, inviting the viewer's participation. At the left two other family members, dressed in senatorial red, pay their eloquent devotion to the relic, the middle-aged man reaching out as if to share his adoration with others. Titian records and contrasts the emotions of his subjects; the sober obedience of the adolescents at left and the innocent play of the children at right serve to underscore the maturity and depth of the adults' piety, as civic, as well as personal virtue.Titian is supposed to have said a painter only needed three colours: white, black and red.

Nothing appears to have occurred between 1330 and 1380 to render Giotto's prototype out of date: the latter painting reveals no startling new approach. Only the proportions have been elongated in accordance with Gothic ideal of elegance; otherwise the design has been followed faithfully. Where the differences lie is in nuances of colour, and it is these nuances that reveal a Florentine tradition and its development	GADDI, Agnolo	Coronation of the Virgin	Egg tempera on wood, 184 x 94 cm	1380-85	religious	Italian	1351-1400

25111-4portrai.jpg	Although abraded in places, this little portrait proves that the Master of the Legend of St Ursula as a minor master was capable of a high degree of refinement and that he was an exceptionally talented colourist. The dark purple colour of the upper garment against the dark green-blue of the plain background creates a remarkably cool, almost nocturnal effect. The white carnation, which one would normally have expected to be red as the symbol of love, adds to the sober mood. Although there are no traces of hinges, it is not impossible that this little work had a separate man's portrait as its pendant. The meaning of the white carnation is unclear. The lighter halo around the head is probably the result of overcleaning	MASTER of the Legend of Saint Ursula (I)	Portrait of a Lady with a Carnation	Oil on oak panel, 24,5 x 20,3 cm	1480-1500	portrait	Flemish	1451-1500

17258-auvers18.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 789, JH 2006.In this painting the church in Auvers has been transformed by the artist into a vision using form and colour. Painted in portrait format, the church towers up before the onlooker like a fortification. The path leading to it forks in the foreground into two narrow paths passing the church on either side. On the path to the left, her back turned toward us, a peasant woman is walking into the distance. The path is bathed in light, while the church is viewed against the backdrop of a dark blue sky that merges with the black-blue of the night sky at the edges of the picture. The brushwork is restless and full of movement, and the forms of the church are distorted in the Expressionist manner	GOGH, Vincent van	The Church at Auvers	Oil on canvas, 94 x 74 cm	June 1890, Auvers-sur-Oise	landscape	Dutch	1851-1900

10397-03adamev.jpg	This depiction by Lucas Cranach the Younger of the founders of the human race was part of a tradition in the Cranach workshop that spanned many decades. Lucas Cranach the Elder had produced a number of variants from 1509 onwards. Apart from small-sized versions on panel, we know of life-size pairs of paintings also by Lucas Cranach the Elder. Albrecht Dürer's first independent formulations of this theme in 1504 and 1507 were certainly the inspiration for Cranach's work on the subject. But unlike Dürer, Cranach was less interested in Antiquity and classical proportions, and operated rather within north Alpine traditions that were strongly influenced by Burgundian-Dutch forms.Cranach's fundamental principle of varying individual motifs is illustrated in his depictions of Adam and Eve. Not only the posture and the vocabulary of gestures, but also the positioning of the fig-leaves, the background design and the representations of the animals can be found in either similar or identical form in the various versions that came from the Cranach workshop. The method of combining individual components to produce a striking overall impression gives a special quality to the Cranachs' works, which are never mere copies of previous designs	CRANACH, Lucas the Younger	Adam and Eve	Oil on lime wood panel, 171 x 63 cm (each)	after 1537	religious	German	1501-1550
07921-margaret.jpg	This altarpiece in a chapel in Santa Caterina dei Funari, Rome was commissioned by Gabriele Bombasi, a member of the Farnese entourage. The figure of the saint was taken directly from The Madonna of St Luke (now in the Louvre) which Annibale Carracci had painted for the cathedral in Reggio Emilia in 1592. The figure was copied by Lucio Massari (1569-1633), a pupil of Carracci, and Annibale carried out the finishing touches	CARRACCI, Annibale	St Margaret	Oil on canvas, 239 x 134 cm	1597-99	religious	Italian	1551-1600
08805-autumn.jpg	Autumn landscapes were often painted by Church, who exploited the possibilities autumn gave for brilliant colouring, from the blue sky in the upper left to the intense reds of the leaves.

25050-altarpie.jpg	The central panel of the Holy Kinship Altarpiece depicts the Holy Kinship.

On the exterior of the wings are Sts Hermolaus, Achatius and his followers on the left, and on the right Sts Cecilia, Genevieve, Helen and Catherine, each with members of the donor's family. The altar was probably a donation to the Dominican convent of St Achatius where one of the donor's daughters was a nun.The artist of the altarpiece is referred to as the Master of the Holy Kinship	MASTER of the Holy Kinship	The Holy Kinship Altarpiece (central panel)	Oak, 144 x 187 cm	1500-03	religious	German	1501-1550
10654-10csont.jpg	"The angular figure of the Saviour is standing in the middle isolated from everything and everybody. He is raising up his hands  as if praying or preaching. The group of the twelve  apostles are looking out of the picture. Dr. Rezsõ Pertorini, author of the Csontváry pathogaph, grouped them as people shouting, ""Crucify him,"" as if they were a choir in a Greek tragedy. Faces are suggestive, those of the Saviour and Moses are expressive.The picture condenses events. Moses is standing with stone tablets on the left. The silhouette of a town can be seen in the background, it is Jerusalem. On the right, there is a slim tree with a block of stone at its foot with two black figures tumbling on it. Behind the tree, there is a modern church which is lit: it can be approached on a steep slope. Next to it, there are three columns with winged sculptures and a domed building on the left. A group of people are approaching the church. The picture has a complicated and symbolic message, in fact, the painter attempted to sum up the history of christianity. He portrayed the Old Testament on the left and the New Testament on the right: the former  being represented by Moses and the tables of the Testament, and the New Testament by Jesus' sermon, payer, and desciples, the tree symbolizing the cross, and the mourners with a stone suggesting a grave.There are symbolic objects and scenes on both sides. The  background stretches out to the distance. Thus, the painter emphasizes the main characters. The composition is balanced. The connection between time and space, and the suggestivity of tools with expressive power are in  harmony with one another"	CSONTVÁRY KOSZTKA, Tivadar	Praying Saviour	Oil on canvas, 100 x 82 cm	1903	religious	Hungarian	1851-1900
05673-adoratio.jpg	Boucher had never been a committed artistic believer. Although he had worked in Italy, the Italian tradition did not tempt him into vast imaginative schemes. He never aimed at a heroic vision. He expressed no glorious promises about heaven: either as an Olympian refuge for aristocratic families, or in ordinary Christian terms. Like most French eighteenth-century painters, he could not evolve a satisfactory idiom for religious pictures of any kind; and he was particularly unsuited to the task by the nature of his real abilities.The picture shows one of his rare paintings of religious subject	BOUCHER, François	Adoration of the Shepherds	Oil on canvas	1750	religious	French	1701-1750
41328-040madon.jpg	This panel, showing Mary as Queen of Heaven, was probably originally the centre of a triptych or tabernacle.In Italy, with its profound piety, images of Christ and the Virgin Mary were found early on, in contrast to northern Europe. Altarpieces such as the Lucca Madonna were already common in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. This cult image is strongly traditional and yet has elements of content and form that anticipate future developments	UNKNOWN MASTER, Italian	Madonna Enthroned with the Christ Child	Canvas laid over poplar, 104 x 63 cm	c. 1260	religious	Italian	1251-1300
28916-contarin.jpg	The reputation of Moroni of Bergamo rests primarily on his numerous portraits although, like his master, Moretto da Brescia, he also painted altarpieces and religious compositions. His models were, for the most part, the patricians, bourgeois scholars and artisans living in the small towns of Northern Italy. Usually he painted them at work with the tools of their particular trade: the scholar is seen holding a book or writing implements, the tailor is about to cut his cloth.According to a later inscription at the top right, this is a portrait of Jacopo Contarini, Podesta of Padua. However, Padua never had a Podesta of this name and, since it is known that Jacopo Foscarini filled that office when the picture was painted, we can only assume that the inscription is inaccurate and that the portrait is indeed of Foscarini. He is shown as a distinguished man of middle age with an air of seriousness that commands respect. Only the serene harmony of greys and reds resolves the sombre mood of the painting	MORONI, Giovanni Battista	Portrait of Jacopo Foscarini	Oil on canvas, 105 x 84 cm	1575	portrait	Italian	1551-1600
42753-2castel1.jpg	Despite several formal inconsistencies, the altar painting for the church of San Fermo Maggiore in Verona is an expression of Veronese's early mastery.

15654-dead_chr.jpg	The Incarnation of Christ and his death are depicted in this panel, which is divided into two sectors, one above the other.The deceased Christ is portrayed in half length with his arms crossed on his chest. His head is tilted to one side and his eyes are closed, with a cross on his halo and the stigmata clearly visible on his hands and ribs. Two angels at his sides are richly embellished with diadems and halos on their heads and with capes and wings. They also have their arms crossed like Christ, a gesture that expresses resignation for the unavoidable divine sacrifice.In the lower sector, the infant Jesus is lying on the ground, barely covered by a transparent cloth; his small body emits strong rays of light. Two angels kneel behind him with their hands clasped together. They wear diadems and have halos above their heads. The Madonna, with her arms crossed on her chest, and Saint Joseph, with his hands clasped together in adoration, are kneeling before the child	GHISSI, Francescuccio	The Dead Christ and the Adoration of the Infant Jesus	Tempera and gold on wood, 39 x 29 cm	after 1373	religious	Italian	1351-1400
43793-18actors.jpg	Until the end of the seventeenth century the theater of the great tragic playwrights and of Molière inspired painters little or not at all, apart from illustrated editions. Change occurred when Claude Gillot and his pupil Antoine Watteau drew a great deal on 'commedia del'arte' characters, which had been familiar to the French public for a century, though mainly on a burlesque level. The Italian Commedia dell'Arte troupe, which had been banned in 1697, was reestablished in 1716. Watteau's Actors from the Comédie Française, a light, silvery canvas, gives an idea of their theatrical costumes and gestures	WATTEAU, Jean-Antoine	Actors from the Comédie Française	Oil on canvas, 57 x 73 cm	c. 1720	genre	French	1701-1750
05308-31right.jpg	The right wing represents St Anthony in Meditation.The powerful evocation of a corrupt and stinking world is no less apparent in the right wing, where Bosch used as his starting point the story of the Devil-Queen, a subject he had already depicted in the Hermit Saints altarpiece. The Devil-Queen appears in the river before Anthony, shielding her private parts with a false modesty and surrounded by her infernal court. Anthony averts his eyes from this obscene group only to be summoned by a demon-herald to the devilish feast in the foreground. The open-air table, the cloth slung tent-like over the tree stump beside the temptress, and the servants pouring wine seem like a grotesque parody of the traditional Garden of Love. In the background looms the city of the Devil-Queen, its demonic nature betrayed by the dragon swimming in the moat and by the flames erupting from the top of the main gate	BOSCH, Hieronymus	Triptych of Temptation of St Anthony (right wing)	Oil on panel, 131,5 x 53 cm	1505-06	religious	Netherlandish	1451-1500

42128-09casafl.jpg	This fresco is part of the paintings decorating the house of Vasari in Florence.It is characteristic of Vasari's self-confidence that the artistic and intellectual effort he invested in designing his own home was comparable to that which he expended on the residences of those who commissioned his work. He decorated his house in Arezzo between 1542 and 1548; toward the end of his life he also frescoed his Florentine house, which had been given to him by Duke Cosimo I in 1561. In both cases the paintings refer to the role of the painter, who saw himself in the tradition of ancient painters (to whom individual episodes of both cycles are devoted)	VASARI, Giorgio	The Studio of the Painter	Fresco	c. 1563	genre	Italian	1551-1600
34263-gregory.jpg	"Ricci was an exuberant personality, internationally renowned and an archetypal ""traveling"" painter. After training in the Veneto, Ricci spent some time in Emilia (Bologna, Parma and Piacenza). This proved crucial to his development as his style was influenced by the local classicism, deepened when Ricci made a trip to Rome, where Annibale Carraci's frescos in Palazzo Farnese deeply moved him. After a brief trip to Vienna, Ricci went back to Venice in 1708, where his art changed. His Altarpiece of St Gregory the Great was a deliberate homage to Paolo Veronese and inaugurated a totally new era in eighteenth-century Venetian painting, trying to revive the glories of its Renaissance. Compared to his earlier works, his art was now remarkably free in composition and brushwork. This new style of painting was an immediate success. By 1711 Sebastiano had joined his nephew Marco Ricci in London where he remained for five years, working for many great noblemen."

42738-mazeppa1.jpg	Vernet's oil study Mazeppa of 1826, done in advance of the large painting in the Musée Calvet in Avignon, was based on a theme from Lord Byron's verse epic of the same name, which was translated into French soon after its publication in 1819. The story relates how Mazeppa, a Cossack chief, made illicit advances to the daughter of a Polish prince. As punishment, he was tied naked to the back of a wild horse, which galloped off with him. Exhausted to the point of death, he was finally saved by a Cossack girl.Mazeppa not only represents a man whose animal instincts caused him to be subjected to an animal fate; he also embodies the outcast and pariah who is condemned by society. In this regard, Mazeppa could figure as a romantic symbol of artistic self-reliance and determination	VERNET, Horace	Mazeppa	Oil on canvas, 33 x 41 cm	1826	other	French	1801-1850

44528-federi06.jpg	The mid-nineteenth century in Italy was the period of the Risorgimento, the movement that culminated in Italian unification. That movement provided the political and cultural backdrop for one of the most important and influential groups in Italian art in the second half of the nineteenth century: the Macchiaioli. This group of landscape, portrait and genre painters, flourishing from about 1850 to 1880, was based on Florence. The core of the Macchiaioli consisted of eleven painters born between 1824 and 1838, most important of them among the older painters were Giovanni Fattori, Silvestro Lega, Serafino de Tivoli, and Vincenzo Cabianca, while Giuseppe Abbati and Telemaco Signorini belonged to the younger. There were some other artists associated with the group to varying extent, such as Guglielmo Ciardi, Giuseppe de Nittis, Federigo Zandomeneghi, and Giovanni Boldini. The last-named three all took their bearings from France, and eventually moved to Paris.Zandomeneghi settled in Paris in 1874, living a reclusive life, and, unsuccessful in his lifetime, was obliged to earn a living doing fashion drawings. He exhibited in the 1879, 1881, and 1886 Impressionist exhibitions. In street scenes such as Place d'Anvers, Paris his brushwork was relaxed and sketchy	ZANDOMENEGHI, Federico	Place d'Anvers, Paris	Oil on canvas, 100 x 135 cm	1880	landscape	Italian	1851-1900

In the so-called Olympus Room he frescoed Mars, Venus and Amor; Mercury; Time; Jupiter; and Apollo and Diana. This last fresco shows the two deities sitting on a cloud. Apollo, who faces the viewer, holds his lyre in his right hand and his quiver of arrows in his left, while Diana, partly concealed and with her back to the viewer, reclines to his right. Apollo's golden yellow robe and the yellowish colour of the clouds are meant to allude to his office as Sun God	TIEPOLO, Giovanni Battista	Apollo and Diana	Fresco, 200 x 185 cm	1757	mythological	Italian	1701-1750
04468-market_s.jpg	The painter depicts objects in every-day use, primarily tools, kitchen appliances and dishes made of diverse materials, which correspond in every detail to the equipment used at the time. The costumes of the figures mirror the clothes worn at the time by Dutch market women and country folk.This painting shows three people: a man edges closer to the younger of two market women, apparently with an unequivocal proposition. The two are surrounded by the goods for sale, such as butter, cheese, eggs and poultry in baskets, barrels and on wooden cheese plates. The goods displayed in such abundance in Beuckelaer's painting bear a metaphorical message which is erotic rather than religious. They are perceived as aphrodisiacs or used colloquially as synonyms for sexual feelings and practices	BEUCKELAER, Joachim	Market Scene	Oil on oak, 111 x 164 cm	1563	genre	Flemish	1551-1600

Its painted decoration, completed in 1704 by the elderly Luca Giordano, constituted the last phase of the decoration of the charterhouse.Giordano painted Judith in Triumph over Holofernes on the cupola vault. The figure that appears to dominate the vault is the heroic Judith triumphantly displaying the head of Holofernes to the people of Israel.

09537-lastjudg.jpg	In Munich in 1836 Cornelius received a major commission to decorate the altar wall of the Ludwigskirche with the fresco of the Last Judgment. Basically it is oriented to Michelangelo's fresco in the Sistine Chapel, but is easily half as big again, so it is now the largest fresco in the world. It proved fatal for Cornelius. The individual elements simply would not resolve into a unified composition. Cornelius was overwhelmed with criticism as soon as the painting was finished, and there were acrimonious disputes with King Ludwig I of Bavaria.

35423-43religi.jpg	Religious flower still-lifes are a special category, first developed by the Fleming Daniel Seghers, a pupil of Jan Brueghel the Elder. However, this can be traced back to Rubens's Madonna in Floral Wreath (with the collaboration of Jan Brueghel the Elder). This represents a picture within a picture with an authoritative religious significance, encircled by a floral arrangement and cherubs. Unlike Seghers, however, Rubens did not quote Mary and Jesus as historical traditions or pictorial relics. Instead he preferred to give the impression that they were physically present, even though the motif of a picture within a picture would have been ideally suited for illusionist stylization.This painting is a good example of the encounter of talents of Rubens and Jan Brueghel the Elder, one much appreciated by collectors. Each exhibits his own virtuosity, Rubens painting the figures and Brueghel the floral decoration	RUBENS, Peter Paul	Madonna in Floral Wreath	Oil on oak, 185 x 209,8 cm	c. 1620	religious	Flemish	1601-1650

08065-strawbo1.jpg	Carrier-Belleuse's portraits of women are few, and for them he often worked in a neo-Rococo mode, participating in the eighteenth-century revival that began and flourished in the mid-nineteenth century. The identity of the sitter of the present bust is unknown. The women Carrier-Belleuse portrayed were generally actresses or singers, wives or daughters of friends, and high society ladies, whose identities were discreetly concealed	CARRIER-BELLEUSE, Albert-Ernest	Girl in a Straw Bonnet	Terracotta, height 92 cm	1868-70	portrait	French	1851-1900
02504-6elem1.jpg	This painting is identifiable with a picture of Air by Arcimboldo. It is a copy after Arcimboldo's painting, or perhaps a workshop version from a later series of elements, or perhaps a repetition made for the emperor.Like Earth and probably Water in the series, Air is also based on studies from nature. Many of the birds whose heads are seen in this composite were drawn by Arcimboldo, along with many other avian species. However, because they are crowded together, the individual species represented here are harder to identify	ARCIMBOLDO, Giuseppe	Air	Oil on canvas, 74 x 56 cm	c. 1566	mythological	Italian	1551-1600

40447-calvary.jpg	Ugolino Lorenzetti (or Ugolino-Lorenzetti) is an invented name for an unknown artist midway between the styles of Ugolino da Siena and the Lorenzetti. Also known as the Ovile Master (Maestro di San Pietro Ovile), he has been tentatively identified with Bartolommeo Bulgarini (active c. 1347-d. 1378) who is known to have been a painter.The altarpiece displays features that derive from Byzantine artistic tradition: the depiction of figures on different scales, the placement of the groups, and architecture shown from several viewpoints simultaneously	UGOLINO-LORENZETTI	Calvary	Tempera on panel, 92 x 56 cm	1340-60	religious	Italian	1301-1350
25210-0_virgin.jpg	This painting, depicting the Virgin seated among four female martyrs, was probably painted for a nunnery. The painter very subtly included the saints' attributes as ornaments on chains around their neck. On the left is Catherine with the wheel on which she was tortured. Cecilia, behind her, has her organ, Barbara her tower, and Ursula is adorned with the arrow that pierced her heart.A number of late 15th-century  works were grouped around this picture at the beginning of the 20th century, and the artist was christened the Master of the Virgo inter Virgines after this painting	MASTER of the Virgo inter Virgines	Virgin and Child with Sts Catherine, Cecilia, Barbara, and Ursula	Oil on panel, 123 x 102 cm	c. 1490	religious	Netherlandish	1451-1500

43001-4finding.jpg	This small painting, which probably came from the collection of Charles I of England, is one of the earliest and best versions of an Old Testament subject inspired by the works of the painter Bonifazio de'Pitati. Several replicas in Veronese's own hand are known, together with a number of variants and sundry derivations carried out with the help of the workshop.The scene is a river bank in a highly atmospheric landscape. The story tells of an infant boy left out in a basket on the Nile, who is found by Pharaohs daughter and brought up by her as her own son, Moses. The bridge and city are reminiscent of Verona. The delicately nuanced interplay of light and shade, achieved with a fine brush, unfolds to produce the glowing effect of brilliant jewels	VERONESE, Paolo	The Finding of Moses	Oil on canvas, 50 x 30 cm	c. 1580	religious	Italian	1551-1600
34347-talmont.jpg	The painting depicts the death of Charles de la Trémoille, Prince of Talmont and Mortagne after the battle of Marignano in 1515.

32334-02ignazi.jpg	"This spectacular composition is almost an inventory of Baroque architectural ceilings and their final triumph. According to Jesuit ideas, the space within a church was a single area in which the faithful congregated. In Sant'Ignazio space is stretched (Pozzo was clever at the illusion of ""doubling"" the perspective of the real architecture) before exploding into light and glory. Saints, angels, allegories, and floating clouds accentuate the virtuoso effect. The impression is one of exuberance and freedom. In reality, it was worked out using scientific criteria.Designed to be viewed from a point in the centre of the nave, which is marked by a white stone, Padre Pozzo's ceiling produces the illusion of a palace opening on the sky."

14348-jesusdoc.jpg	Following the restoration of Spanish rule and Catholic worship in Antwerp in 1585, the city fathers ordered the crafts and guilds to reinstall their altars in the Cathedral. Among the first to respond were the Schoolmasters and the Soap-boilers, who shared an altar in the church. They contracted Frans Francken to paint a triptych showing Jesus among the Doctors. (The left wing depicts St Ambrose Baptising St Augustine, while the right wing the Miracle of the Flowing Oil.)The scenes plainly have most to do with the schoolmasters. The centre panel shows the episode from St Luke's Gospel in which the twelve-year-old Jesus debates theology with the Jewish scribes in the Temple at Jerusalem. His parents, who have found him after a long search, look somewhat dejected. The Temple is represented by a Renaissance church interior with a menorah and the Ark of the Covenant in the background.The left wing shows Ambrose, the patron saint of Antwerp's schoolmasters, baptising St Augustine in the presence of a canon-scholaster and several council members from the Schoolmasters' Guild. The only reference to the Soap-boilers is in the right wing, where the Bible story of the Miracle of the Flowing Oil is depicted. The prophet Elisha helped the widow of Zarephath out of debt by causing her oil jug to continuously replenish itself - an appropriate theme, for oil was one of the ingredients used by the soap-boilers.The style of the triptych is sober and didactic, as befits the schoolmasters, if not the soapmakers. The balanced composition with its symmetrically arranged groups and the restrained presentation of the principal theme, without many secondary scenes or symbols, is characteristic of the Italian Renaissance, the latest artistic trend at the time	FRANCKEN, Frans I	Jesus among the Doctors	Oil on wood, 250 x 220 cm (centre panel), 250 x 97 cm (wings)	1587	religious	Flemish	1551-1600
14913-1ponta01.jpg	Gauguin met Charles Laval (1862-1894) at Pont-Aven in the summer of 1886 and the younger artist became his pupil. The two were to journey to Panama and Martinique together the following year. Gauguin's role as mentor is alluded to in the way in which Laval gazes fixedly at the ceramic pot which was made by Gauguin in the winter of 1886-87, when he worked in Paris with the ceramicist Chaplet.The still-life with its piled up fruits, treated with tight diagonal brushstrokes and laid out on a white cloth, is reminiscent of Cézanne's painting Still-Life with Compotier which Gauguin owned at this date. At the same time, the oddly truncated head in the foreground is a homage to Degas, who had exhibited with Gauguin at the final Impressionist exhibition that year	GAUGUIN, Paul	Still-Life with Portrait of Laval	Oil on canvas, 46 x 38 cm	1886	still-life	French	1851-1900

39772-01bluesl.jpg	The biographer Giorgio Vasari, in his Life of Titian, describes a similar portrait which he says could easily have been mistaken for a Giorgione if Titian had not signed it. This portrait was erroneously identified by early critics as the portrait of Ariosto; it is perhaps a likeness of Titian's earliest patron, a member of the noble Barbarigo family. In his early period, Titian's portraits are strongly realistic. The painting in its gripping tonal palpability and attention to detail, such as the stitching in the satin, has much in common with Giorgione's late portraits. But Titian, somewhat competitively, carries Giorgione's realism a step further in the way the sleeve billows out and invades our space, extending the boundaries of Giorgionismo in a burst of hyperrealism. The sitter's expression is arrogant, typical of the male dandy. The figure stands out in bold relief against the plain background and the colour emphasizes the unusual lighting, revealing the mood of the sitter as well as capturing his physical presence	TIZIANO Vecellio	Man with the Blue Sleeve	Oil on canvas, 85 x 70 cm	c. 1510	portrait	Italian	1501-1550

40883-05portra.jpg	The young man is placed against a plain red background. Clothing and Italian hairstyle are related to some of Memling's portraits of the 1480s. The hands, too, which only stick out over the frame with the tops of the fingers, are inspired by Memling.Formerly it was considered to be an early Memling, but today the portrait is no longer accepted as an autograph work. The disproportion between head and body and the lack of fine detail suggest a minor master. In the stiff tubular fingers and heavy thumb there is a hint of the manner of the Lucy Master. Moreover, the powerful features and the rough, somewhat vulgar expression with widely separated eyes also seem to fit this master's typology	UNKNOWN MASTER, Flemish	Portrait of a Young Man at Prayer	Oil on oak panel, 30,5 x 21,5 cm	1480s	portrait	Flemish	1451-1500

35439-71religi.jpg	Although Rubens run a large workshop, he was perfectly honest about his proceedings. Studio works were rigorously distinguished from those to which he had, to a greater or lesser extent, contributed. Philip IV of Spain wanted works by Rubens, and he wanted them in quantity; Rubens himself supplied them, and no assistants were permitted to help him.

20194-oudekerk.jpg	In this scene set around the pulpit in the Oude Kerks's nave, Houckgeest departs from his main interest in the works of 1650-51 which are concerned with the Delft churches themselves and their most important tomb monuments. Here the principal points of interest include the casual encounter of a man and woman in the foreground, the illusionistic curtain and wood frame; the picturesque sunlight streaming through crystalline air; the coral colour of the column bases, of the brick arches in the transept, and of figures in the stained-glass.The painting is signed in monogram and dated centre bottom on the fictive frame, in foreshortening: GH 165(1)	HOUCKGEEST, Gerard	Interior of the Oude Kerk, Delft, with the Pulpit of 1548	Oil on panel, 49 x 41 cm	1651	interior	Dutch	1601-1650

40732-13icon.jpg	"The central idea of this image, whose eastern Christian iconography can be traced back to the high middle ages, consists in the representation of the Savior's triumph over death and over the evil forces of Satan, as celebrated in the Easter troparion of the Byzantine liturgy: ""Christ is risen from the dead, by his death he has vanquished death, and to those who were in their tombs he has given life.""The present icon represents, at the centre, Christ in glory, resplendent in a burst of golden light. He is placed within an azure mandorla, graduated in tone and hatched with golden rays. Treading upon the gates of hell, which have been thrown off their hinges and flung to the ground, Christ is flanked by two groups of personages: they are the Just of the Old Covenant, prominent among whom are the figures of King David (with the crown), Moses, and Saint John the Baptist. In the persons of Adam and Eve, rising from their tombs in the form of sarcophagi, the whole of humanity is here being won and redeemed.Based on its characteristics this icon may be related to the Byzantine school of Veliko Tarnova of the late seventeenth century"	UNKNOWN ICON PAINTER, Bulgarian	The Resurrection of Christ	Tempera on linen and wood, 24 x 18 cm	1675-1700	religious	Other	1651-1700
02773-apple.jpg	Still-life paintings were popular in Dutch art and began to emerge as a genre in their own right during the 16th century.

15524-1expuls.jpg	The narration of the story of Mary on the left wall of the chapel starts at the bottom at the entrance to the chapel with the Expulsion of Joachim from the Temple.In the centre of the loggia with broad round arches and built on a cross-shaped ground plan, a high priest is receiving sacrificial lambs at the altar where a fire is burning. As the old Joachim does not yet have any descendants, he is not allowed to take part in the sacrificial rite, and is sent away. Symmetrical groups of Florentine citizens frame this biblical scene, and in the group on the right, the artist has depicted himself and some members of his family.This episode follows the traditional lines of composition. Of significance here is the architecture, which the artist obviously felt was more important than the events. In the upper half of the painting it takes up more space than the figures, who occupy only the bottom part of the picture. The most important figures - and not only the biblical ones - are standing at the front edge of the picture. All the other scenes follow this basic principle.In the background, Ghirlandaio's depiction of the widely spaced loggia and its medallions is a direct quotation of the Spedale degli Innocenti, the foundling hospital in Florence designed by Brunelleschi. Interestingly enough, there is a repetition of this façade, constructed shortly after Ghirlandaio's frescoes were painted, that can be seen when leaving the church of Santa Maria Novella at the other end of the piazza by the Spedale di San Paolo (built 1489 -1498).Above the portraits are two palaces whose lines run parallel with those of the temple. Comparable buildings, with rusticated lower stories and open upper stories, largely characterize the appearance of Florence to this day. This was one way in which Ghirlandaio repeatedly brought the city into his paintings.Contemporaries of the artist and clients are present as spectators and witnesses of the expulsion of Joachim, and because of their fashionable clothing and shoes and their vain hairstyles they differ conspicuously from the biblical participants. It is thought that the noblemen on the left include the client's son, Lorenzo Tornabuoni, and his friend Piero, the son of Lorenzo de' Medici. In the group at the right Ghirlandaio depicts famous contemporary artists (including himself) who can be identified from the description of Vasari as Alesso Baldovinetti, Bastiano Mainardi, Davide and Domenico Ghirlandaio.

42271-0606vela.jpg	In a manner that is always striking and sometimes curiously moving to modern observers, Velázquez shows human nature in all its diversity when he presents the gallery of dwarfs and jesters who lived at court and whose task it was to preserve the king from boredom in the midst of routine etiquette.Under cover of joking, the court jesters or buffoons, in Spanish truhanes, would often tell their lords and masters the home truths openly discussed by the ordinary people. They could move freely in the king's presence, trying to amuse the naturally melancholic Philip IV with their caustic remarks. To judge by their salaries, their position in society was quite high. Velázquez himself, on entering the service of the palace as a court painter, had at first been classed with the royal servants, and as a result shared the life of these truhanes.Velázquez painted a masterly picture of the buffoon Don Cristóbal de Casta&#241;eda y Pernia, who was first in rank among the court jesters. He gave himself airs as a great military expert, thus earning the nickname of Barbarroja (Barbarossa or Red-beard). The ambitious buffoon aspired to military roles and he even acted as toreador in the arena although he was ill-fitted for doing it. His red robe is almost Turkish in style, and his head-dress suggests a fool's cap. He glares fiercely into space, and while he grips the sheath of his sword firmly, the sword itself is held in a relaxed position	VELÁZQUEZ, Diego Rodriguez de Silva y	The Buffoon Don Cristóbal de Casta?eda y Pernia (Barbarroja)	Oil on canvas, 200 x 121 cm	1637-40	portrait	Spanish	1601-1650

The fanciful studies from life, often exotically costumed, that Lievens, Rembrandt, and their followers painted in large numbers are not portraits as such and are known as tronies, the term for them that was in use at least by 1630.

44513-landsc_r.jpg	In the 1740s the rustic scenes of Zais acquire a simplicity and sincerity more like the pastoral scenes of Zuccarelli with their more light-hearted themes and softer colour. Landscape with River and Bridge is a fine example of the balance of colour and atmosphere achieved by Zais in his works of this period. Here the traditional composition and classical composure of this carefully staged landscape are enlivened by a rustic element, as is often the case in the works of Zais	ZAIS, Giuseppe	Landscape with River and Bridge	Oil on canvas, 97 x 143 cm	c. 1740	landscape	Italian	1701-1750
37293-32madonn.jpg	The two Madonnas in the Siena Pinacoteca, one from Castiglione d'Orcia and the other from Lucignano d'Arbia, are clearly related and must date from more or less the same period. But we have no dates, no signatures and no documents containing any information at all regarding the dating of these works: stylistic analysis is the only element that critics have been able to use. This justifies the widely varying opinions that have been expressed on the subject: some scholars believe that they are totally autograph, while others think that Simone is responsible only for the drawings or for certain sections of the painting, while others still consider them entirely the work of the workshop assistants.Nonetheless, there are many analogies between the various paintings from this period, such as for example, the features of the Madonna in the San Domenico Polyptych, with her gentle and slightly dreaming eyes, repeated almost exactly in the Madonna in the Orvieto Polyptych; or the lively pose of the Child in the panel from Castiglione d'Orcia which is exactly the same as that of the Child in the Boston painting	SIMONE MARTINI	Madonna and Child (from Castiglione d'Orcia)	Tempera on wood	1320-25	religious	Italian	1301-1350
18467-dubarry.jpg	Born to humble beginnings as the daughter of a seamstress, the Comtesse du Barry (1746-1793), née Marie Jeanne Bécu, rose to become one of the most famous figures in the court of Louis XV. Her influence was born out of her legendary powers of seduction, which she used to gain the title of Ma&#238;tresse-en-titre (chief mistress of the King of France), the last to fill the position in the court of Louis XV.Madame du Barry's support for the arts was also legendary, and she came to amass one of the great collections in France in the 18th century. She had her portrait painted by some of the leading artists of the day, including Louise Élisabeth Vigée-Lebrun, François-Hubert Drouais, and Jean-Baptiste Greuze	GREUZE, Jean-Baptiste	Portrait of the Comtesse du Barry	Oil on canvas, 60 x 48 cm	c. 1771	portrait	French	1751-1800
40232-s_luca_2.jpg	There are seven paintings of Tura of dimension very similar which certainly belonged to one or two polyptychs. Two lost altarpieces can be taken into account: one in San Luca in Borgo at Ferrara and another in San Giacomo at Argenta. There are several proposals of the reconstruction of these altarpieces. According to one suggestions the San Luca polyptych probably had the Madonna (presently in Bergamo) in the centre, St Anthony of Padua (presently in the Musée du Louvre, Paris), St Dominic, St Sebastian (presently in Berlin), St Christopher (presently in Berlin) on the side panels	TURA, Cosm?

29493-drawingl.jpg	Van der Neer's first pictures date to the 1660s, the decade in which Dou, Frans van Mieris, Gerard Terborch, and Gabriel Metsu were at the height of their careers, working in a flourishing market awash with disposable income. Van der Neer's paintings from this early period, among them his Lady Drawing of about 1665, clearly resembles these masters' works. Its subject can be linked to a work by Metsu while the lady's shimmering satin attire and the overall, serene ambience of the panel strongly recall paintings by Terborch.The Lady Drawing is probably not meant to represent a professional woman artist at work but rather a female member of the upper classes practicing drawing. Daughters of elite families were sometimes taught the rudiments of art (which could encompass drawing, painting, or even calligraphy), along with music and poetry in order to enhance their standing in society, particularly among respectable suitors	NEER, Eglon van der	A Lady Drawing	Oil on panel, 30 x 26 cm	c. 1665	genre	Dutch	1651-1700
04069-vastato.jpg	The picture shows the choir vault and apse with illusionistic architecture and scenes from the life of the Virgin (Annunciation, Assumption).The most important setting for the fictive dissolution of ceilings and walls with painting intended to evoke and illustrate heavenly sphere was the church, with its choir tribunes, inner façades, vaults and cupolas. The new type of the hall church evolved following the prototype of the Il Ges&#249; in Rome, and offered fresco painters an ideal space to work in. The vaulted, single-aisle nave flanked by chapels, transepts flooded by light from the centre cupola, and a spacious choir made possible a sophisticated structuring of the pictorial program in conformity with the architecture.The painterly redecoration of the church of Santissima Annunziata del Vastato in Genoa following its modernization in the style of the Counter-Reformation began around 1625 with the vaults of the aisles.  The painting of the choir by Giulio Benso began in 1635, and there are staged the most important events of the life of the Virgin as a theatrical spectacle. The Annunciation to the Virgin, central to the church's iconography, takes place in the vault, shifted to heavenly spheres with the help of quadratura. The drama of the Annunciation - Mary receives the angel's message in an airy loggia, while God floats down in glory above her - is then outdone by the ecstasy of the choir calotte's Assumption.This theatrical staging is considered one of the most successful combinations, with respect to foreshortening of quadratura and figural painting with the actual architecture	BENSO, Giulio	Choir vault and apse decoration	Fresco	1637-38	religious	Italian	1601-1650

00221-oratory.jpg	The oratory at the west edge of the city centre of Urbino was erected c. 1393. Nothing is known about the commissioning of the paintings on the walls, a cycle depicting scenes from the life of St John the Baptist. The unidentified patron was probably from Rome from where the Salimbeni brothers, Lorenzo and Jacopo, came to Urbino for this commission. Stylistic analysis tells us that another painter was also engaged for the wall frescoes in the oratory. Antonio Alberti was responsible for the scenes from the St John cycle on the left-hand wall and on the inner façade.The picture shows the view of the left-hand (east) long wall of the oratory with fragments of the St John cycle in the upper register. The scenic compartments are considered to be the work of Antonio Alberti.The lower register of the east wall includes several votive pictures, separately framed but also painted on the wall, that must have been executed at roughly the same time as the cycle. The two votive paintings with an enthroned Madonna and saints were painted by the Salimbeni brothers.	ALBERTI, Antonio	St John fresco cycle	Fresco	c. 1416	religious	Italian	1401-1450

Subsequent sale Amsterdam, 1696, no. 4: ""A young lady playing the guitar, very good, of the same; fl 70."" Collection 2d Viscount Palmerston; collection W. Cowper-Temple at Broadland, later Baron Mount-Temple, 1871; art gallery Thos. Agnew, London, 1888. Acquired by the Earl Iveagh, 1889.An old copy, canvas, 48,7 x 41,2 cm, is in the Museum of Art, Philadelphia. The only difference separating this copy from the Kenwood, London, version is the coiffure of the guitar player, whose style points toward c. 1700. It would be interesting to clean this painting and possibly ascertain, by X-rays, whether the original coiffure is still extant and was overpainted at a later date. Otherwise, both paintings are almost equal as far as pictorial quality is concerned.Together with the Lacemaker (Louvre, Paris), this painting constitutes one of the best achievements by Vermeer, and certainly a towering success in his late maturity. By now, the artist had attained the mastery of light and colours, together with complete freedom of expressing himself technically by means of looser brushstrokes that are no longer bound to specifics of texture or materials. The model is not drawn inward but looks to the outside world in full communication and radiance of her pleasure simply to make music. Never was Vermeer more able to liberate himself from all constraints and convey his artistic viewpoint in a more masterly manner.

04474-v_market.jpg	Joachim Beuckelaer took the market and kitchen painting created by Pieter Aertsen, and developed them into an independent genre which remained popular until well into the 17th century. The didactic element of Beuckelaer's paintings did not manifest itself in propaganda on behalf of Catholic orthodoxy, but in the cheerful censure of the wickedness of worldly pleasure. His paintings are full of allusions to sensuality, sexuality and fertility, with vegetables, fruit, fish, meat and cooking utensils piled up around a few figures. In his best works, Beuckelaer mixes a strong sense of space and detail on the one hand, with unity of composition on the other	BEUCKELAER, Joachim	The Vegetable Market	Oil on panel 149 x 215 cm	1567	still-life	Flemish	1551-1600
23184-21monaco.jpg	There are four panels in the Metropolitan Museum in New York representing Old Testament patriarchs, which are among the finest works of Lorenzo Monaco, who, at the time the panels were painted, was the leading master in Florence. The four patriarchs (Abraham, Noah, Moses, and David) are each portrayed seated on a cut stone bench or chest set on a fictive marble dais, which is alternately pink with a strip of green in the foreground (Noah and David) or green with a strip of violet in the foreground (Abraham and Moses).Abraham wears a pink tunic with green shadows, a violet cloak with pink highlights, and a white shawl draped over his shoulders. He holds a silver sword and a firebrand in his right hand and lays his left on the head of his son, Isaac, kneeling in profile before him, dressed in an orange tunic over a gray robe.The function of these four paintings, possibly as flanking elements of an altarpiece, has been debated	LORENZO Monaco	Abraham	Tempera on panel, 66 x 43 cm	1408-10	religious	Italian	1401-1450

30981-catherin.jpg	"The painting, once attributed by Berenson to Piero, was originally a round panel. Traces of the former round edge are visible in the bottom corners, though the picture was later adapted to fit a rectangular frame. The panel is cryptically signed with the initials ""C P L F"", which was correctly understood to mean ""Calistus de Platea Laudendis fecit"". Dated to between the late 1530's and early 1540's, this picture shows the influence of Lombard and Leonardesque currents, which Callisto unites with references to the art of Raphael's Florentine period. The Florentine influences are particularly notable considering that Callisto's city of Lodi was a centre of Lombard painting at the time."

26100-26vani11.jpg	The picture shows one of the panels of the Triptych of Earthly Vanity and Divine Salvation which is made up of three panels, all three of which are painted on both sides. This reversible painting would seem to have been intended for use as an aid to private meditation. When the panels are folded slightly inwards, the triptych will stand unsupported - for example, on a table. Its symbolism centres on the opposition between Good and Evil.

40897-08portra.jpg	Few of the worldly paintings of the 15th century have survived intact. An interesting example of this type of painting is the double portrait by an unknown master referred to as the Master of Frankfurt. Despite his misleading title, the artist in question was an anonymous master working in Antwerp. His Portrait of the Artist and his Wife is one of the first profane double portraits in the art of the Southern Netherlands. All that now survives is the centrepiece of what was originally a triptych, which is evident from the shape of the panel and the traces of hinges which are still visible.

18765-guard307.jpg	The division between quay and water and the human activity around the market stalls and gondolas make up the theme of this view of the Molo. The quay, which is provided with steps and jetties for mooring boats, creates a striking line in the composition running almost at a right angle to the lower edge of the image and leads the eye toward a vanishing point just below the middle of the painting. Depicted at the right is the column of Todaro beyond which the buildings along the Molo continue with the Library, the Zecca and the State Grain Storage Houses all the way to the Fonteghetto della Farina near the entrance of the Grand Canal. A market with simple stalls and awnings occupies the Fondaco del Grano. To the left of the entrance of the Grand Canal can be seen the Punta della Dogana and Santa Maria della Salute and in the distance, to the extreme left, the Redentore. The composition is closed off at this end by a fishing boat which counterbalances the column of Todaro. As several corrections by the painter, visible to the naked eye reveal, Guardi modified the strong perspective of the buildings at the right and moved the Salute closer to the centre of the composition.The view of the Molo in the direction of the entrance to the Grand Canal was a subject frequently depicted in Venetian vedute painting. Initially the view functioned primarily as a setting for festive entries in the Doges' Palace, such as in Luca Carlevaris's Reception of Cardinal Cesar d'Estrees (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam). Later the view of the Molo was usually shown without the Doges' Palace and without any kind of festivity.For this painting, Guardi undoubtedly drew inspiration from a work by Canaletto (c. 1740, private collection) which he may have known through a print by Antonio Visentini from 1742. Not only did Guardi rely on this for his composition, he also borrowed several details from Canaletto such as the little stalls on the Molo and the gondolas floating on the water. However, a comparison with this source makes it clear that Guardi, despite the strong perspectival arrangement of this composition, neither subjected the cityscape to a strict perspectival system nor strove for an exact, detailed rendering of the architecture. For the loosely, vigorously painted figures on the Molo, Guardi more likely found an example in the work of the Genoese painter, Alessandro Magnasco. Furthermore, Guardi's painting is not even half the size of the one by Canaletto.Guardi's small painting and its pendant, a view of the Piazzetta in the direction of San Giorgio Maggiore (also in the Galleria Franchetti, Venice), no longer satisfied the presumably more representative function of Canaletto's painting, but were purchased instead by an individual client who was as interested in the well-known Venetian cityscapes as in Guardi's painterly rendering of them.As with many of Francesco Guardi's paintings, the dating of this work is problematic. It no longer displays the strong stylistic dependence on Canaletto which is characteristic of his earliest cityscapes, nor the brown tonality of his work from the 1760s. The shimmering effects of light and colour, especially in the wall surfaces of the buildings, and the nervous treatment of the sky and the figures on the Molo are characteristic of Guardi's extremely individualistic, transparent style in the last two decades of his career. Therefore, dating this painting to the second half of the 1770s seems plausible	GUARDI, Francesco	View of the Molo towards the Santa Maria della Salute	Oil on canvas, 45 x 71 cm	1775-80	landscape	Italian	1751-1800
05178-cornar04.jpg	The frescoes in the Villa Cornaro are Bortolini's first known works. The works on the first floor focus on episodes from the Old Testament, while those on the upper floor are derived from the New Testament. On the first floor, the small rooms to the left of the main hall are dedicated to the narration of the stories of Moses and King Solomon, while those to the right are reserved for episodes relating to Noah, Abraham, and Jacob. The images are extremely simplified in the presentation of the subject matter.The Judgment of Solomon occurs within the royal palace, where only the protagonists in the event are depicted - the king seated on his throne, the two mothers, the executioner who has been called in to cut the contested newborn in half, while the other baby lies abandoned on the ground.

05761-beethov.jpg	Bourdelle made more than 40 depictions of the great composer. For him, Beethoven became the embodiment of creative energy, which is conveyed here by the expressive painterly treatment of the material, accentuating volume by means of texture and line. The empty and strangely convex eye sockets in this face without a gaze intensify the sense of a force bursting it apart from within, which seems to originate from the mighty arch of the tightly pressed lips.

34277-2bathshe.jpg	The composition of this painting is similar to that of another painting of the same subject by Sebastiano Ricci, now in the Staatliche Museen, Berlin. Both painting follow the scheme used for representing the toilette of Venus. Bathsheba is identified only by the barely visible spying figure in the Budapest painting and by the figure of a maid approaching with a letter from King David.Apparently Ricci liked to use buildings with columns to close up the background, no doubt inspired by Veronese. Slender columns, light, almost floating balconies provide a picturesquely decorative framework for the figures grouped on the stage in front. The whole scene is pervaded by a shimmering silvery light; shadow and dimness have vanished completely; the painter applies light and colour for modelling. The colouring, with its nacreous lustre, is particularly attractive; the hues are delicately shaded, enhancing the interplay of form and content	RICCI, Sebastiano	Bathsheba at her Bath	Oil on canvas, 119 x 199 cm	c. 1724	religious	Italian	1701-1750

25047-altar1.jpg	The Master of the Holy Blood was a Bruges follower of Quentin Massys and he takes his name from a triptych in the Holy Blood Museum in Bruges, which formed the nucleus around which his oeuvre has been reconstructed. This triptych in the Groeninge Museum - displayed in the original frame - is one of his best surviving altarpieces.The main scene represents a Rest on the Flight into Egypt in which the seated Virgin with the Child on her lap is accompanied by St Catherine, who as Christ's bride receives the symbolic ring, and St Barbara who holds a peacock's feather in her hand. It is a rather exceptional combination of the biblical theme with that of the Virgo inter Virgines. There is an echo of Memling in both the general layout as a triptych and the composition of the main scene, which is remotely reminiscent of the St John altarpiece (Memlingmuseum, Bruges).In the middle ground of the rocky landscape three angels are picking figs (a `poetic' variant of the palm-tree miracle) and on the right walks Joseph, perhaps taking the figs to Mary, who indeed holds a fig in her left hand. The donors on the wings, protected respectively by St Joachim and St Judocus, were identified as Joachim Christiaens, orator of the deanery in Bruges (regularly mentioned between 1535 and 1552) and city councillor (in 1530, 1534, 1536 and 1544), and his second wife Jossine Lamsins. In the background of the three panels small scenes are depicted from the legend of the saints in the foreground. On the left wing at the level of the founder's head is the Preaching of St John the Baptist, a scene connected with the patron saint of the former donor. Above this on the hill is the Annunciation to Joachim, which was added later. Behind St Catherine, on the far left next to the rocks, is her martyrdom with the wheel and the heavenly lightning. Behind St Barbara in front of the rocks is the shepherd with his flock who will betray Barbara's hideaway in the rocks to her father. He is shown talking to Barbara's father, while in the scene above Barbara is being threatened by her father in the cave. The pilgrim begging for alms in the right wing at the back is connected with the story of St Judocus.The exterior features an Annunciation in grisaille on a red marbled background.The triptych, which dates from around 1520-25, is the first work by this anonymous master to be found in which donor figures appear, and since it is clearly of Bruges origin, there can be no more doubt about his being active in Bruges.Joachim Christiaens died in 1552 and Jossine Lamsins in 1557. They were both buried by St Michael's altar on the south side of St Donatian's Cathedral, which was probably also the original destination of the triptych	MASTER of the Holy Blood	Virgin and Child with St Catherine and St Barbara	Oil on oak panel, 87,5 x 66 cm (central panel), 88,5 x 28 cm (each wing)	1520-25	religious	Flemish	1501-1550

08827-death1.jpg	In the second half of the 18th century Cignaroli, a native of Verona, was one of the most important representatives of the academic trend. He was fond of large historical compositions and heroic themes, his chief concern being accurate design and historical authenticity, while, in compliance with the changing taste of art and with the new ideas of classicism, he rejected playfulness, facile lightness and pictorial arbitrariness. His dramatic paintings of sombre tone, to be seen in the Budapest Museum of Fine Arts, are didactic in spirit and meant to illustrate exemplary conduct.The painting is signed with the master's name in Greek characters. Its companion-piece, The Death of Cato, is also in Budapest	CIGNAROLI, Giambettino	The Death of Socrates	Oil on canvas, 202 x 271 cm	1762	historical	Italian	1701-1750
25049-lucretia.jpg	Lucretia, the virtuous wife of Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus, committed suicide, as she could not endure the shame of being raped by Sextus Tarquinius, as Livy related. This deed secured the legendary Roman lady a place in the series  of exemplary females that in European  painting, particularly in court circles, were depicted as examples of virtue.In this painting Lucretia is a genteel Flemish bourgeois lady, who having undone her fashionable gown, grasp the dagger with both hands and stabs herself in the heart. This makes the muddy-green veil on her head start an elegant dance and the wide arms of the gown flutter gently. Lucretia is unaccompanied by any of the protagonists of the story, a characteristic of this painting that corresponds to the trend shared by both the North and the South	MASTER of the Holy Blood	Lucretia	Oil on panel, 65 x 49 cm	c. 1530	historical	Flemish	1501-1550
07263-canal713.jpg	Northumberland House at Charing Cross was the London residence of the Earl of Northumberland, who commissioned Canaletto to paint this picture. The house had recently been inherited and refashioned, and Canaletto concentrated his attention on its elegant and mellow façade. The impressive appearance of the building is enhanced by its towers which are surmounted by gilt weather vanes, and the row of obelisks that support lamps on the pavement before it. The house was eventually demolished in 1873, making way for Northumberland Avenue, and the lion above the doorway was then moved to Syon House in Isleworth, Middlesex, where it can still be seen.Canaletto created far more than just a celebration of a particular building, however; he also provides us with an invaluable record of its surroundings, and a vivid impression of the capital coming to life early in the morning. To the right is the statue of Charles I by Hubert Le Sueur (c. 1595-c. 1650) that now stands at the entrance of Whitehall from Trafalgar Square, and at the left is the entrance to the Strand and the Golden Cross Inn, which has a sign standing in front of it.The painting was much copied and engravings were made after it; as a result of the distribution of these copies, it was to have a significant influence on the work of English artists who depicted urban scenes	CANALETTO	London: Northumberland House	Oil on canvas, 84 x 137 cm	1752	landscape	Italian	1701-1750
35743-wheat_f.jpg	In Ruisdael's paintings of the 1670s, like this one, flat landscape subjects are characteristic, as are the converging lines of earth and sky and the alteration of shadow and sunlight.

38229-arachne.jpg	"The mythological story of the contest between the goddess Athena (Minerva to the Romans) and the mortal woman Arachne was perhaps told best by the Roman poet Ovid in his Metamorphoses (Book VI). According to Ovid, Arachne lived in the country of Lydia (which had a legendary reputation for producing some of the most splendid textiles in the ancient world), where she matured into one of the finest weavers ever known. Arachne was in fact so adept at weaving that she became arrogant, and claimed that her ability rivaled that of the goddess Athena.  A contest was arranged, and having been bested by the mortal Arachne, the infuriated goddess cursed the girl, turning her into a spider in punishment for her effrontery.Strozzi's depiction of Arachne is part of a group of bust length depictions of female allegorical and historical figures and of saints that he began to create early on, perhaps in response to the visit to Genoa of Simon Vouet in 1620-22.  Whatever their inspiration, Strozzi produced these beautiful ""portraits"" throughout his career, adapting his depictions to the theme at hand - refined and ethereal for his saints; sensual and seductive for his profane subjects"	STROZZI, Bernardo	Arachne	Oil on cedar panel, 57 x 45 cm	1628-33	mythological	Italian	1601-1650
38645-officer.jpg	An officer set against a dark undefined background, stands on the left, looking down on a young man opposite him, who is seated with his legs apart at a simple low table writing a letter, and leaning forward in deep concentration. In Dutch seventeenth-century art it was usually the women who were represented in the act of writing letters, associated with love and courtship. Terborch depictions of officers writing or receiving letters is without precedent. Earlier scenes with officers and soldiers were set in guardrooms. Dirck Hals, Jan Miense Molenaer, Willem Duyster and Pieter Codde focused on the disruptive characters of soldiers as they drank, gambled, quarrelled and assaulted civilians	TERBORCH, Gerard	An Officer Writing a Letter	Oil on oak panel, 41 x 28 cm	1657-58	genre	Dutch	1651-1700
42764-4transfi.jpg	Accompanied by Peter, James and John, Jesus had gone to Mount Tabor to pray, where the disciples were witnesses to his transfiguration (St. Matthew 17, 5). Unlike Raphael's Transfiguration, in which the Transfiguration, Resurrection and Ascension are combined in the figure of Christ, Veronese's sticks to the text in emphasizing the mystic moment of transfiguration. Linked in a richly graded scale of colour, Christ, Moses and Elijah greatly resemble the figures in his Coronation of the Virgin (in San Sebastiano) in style. The angels tumbling from the clouds and the eloquent gestures of the prostrate disciples provide the dramatic touches	VERONESE, Paolo	Transfiguration of Christ	Oil on canvas, 555 x 260 cm	1555-56	religious	Italian	1551-1600

21328-nicole.jpg	Leaving his poverty-stricken home at the age of 15, La Tour first entered the workshop of an etcher in Paris, then worked in the studio of the painter Jacques-Jean Spoede. With a letter of recommendation from an English ambassador he went to England where he was much impressed by van Dyck's art of portrayal. On his return to Paris he took up pastel painting, possibly inspired by Rosalba Camera's success in Paris in 1720/21. After some experiments he soon came to excel at pastel portraits, surpassing all his rivals, even Peronneau, and gaining great favour at court. La Tour was most demanding in his art so that the execution of a work was often slow, and it was nine years before he produced a work which would admit him to the Academy. His Portrait of Mme de Pompadour of 1755 (Paris, Louvre) and of the President de Rieux in his Study (Paris, Louvre) represent two of the few full-length pastel portraits in existence. His portraits show a vigourous handling and a perceptive grasp of character	LA TOUR, Maurice Quentin de	Portrait of Nicole Richard as Child	Pastel on greyish paper, 454 x 358 mm	1748-50	portrait	French	1701-1750
28530-2trouvi2.jpg	A famous seaside resort on the Normandy coast, Trouville was one of the most popular holiday destinations for Parisian society at around this time. The elegant building is one of the plush, new holiday hotels on the Normandy coast, an area with which the painter had been familiar since childhood. In this painting, thanks to the rapid, expressive brushwork, the clouds appear foreshortened and the flags are fluttering as if in tatters in the wind. Even the figures, like the man raising his hat on the left, are sketchily captured with just a few brush strokes	MONET, Claude	Hôtel des Roches Noires in Trouville	Oil on canvas, 81 x 59 cm	1870	landscape	French	1851-1900
14908-early10.jpg	From November 1884 to June 1885 Gauguin lived in Copenhagen with his wife and family, and it was there that he painted this self-portrait. His letters to friends in Paris chronicle what was for him a difficult period - he missed the cultural life of Paris, disliked the Danes, his wife's family in particular, and the harsh climate meant that he could do little work in the open air. Increasingly he was forced to work indoors, without a model, and his subject matter betrays these constraints. His work became increasingly premeditated. However, in the execution, particularly in the flickering brushwork, this painting is still close to the work of his Impressionist years.Gauguin's rather romantic characterization of the solitary figure labouring in a garret establishes the tenor of much later self-portraits, in which he depicted himself as artistic martyr, culminating in the series of works of 1889 in which he increasingly identified with Christ	GAUGUIN, Paul	Gauguin at His Easel	Oil on canvas, 65 x 54 cm	1885	portrait	French	1851-1900

26023-13john.jpg	The symbolic gesture whereby Jesus places a wedding ring on the finger of St Catherine of Alexandria caused this altarpiece to be identified for many years as the Mystic marriage of St Catherine. Nevertheless, it is clearly dedicated to the Virgin and the two St Johns. Together with the Gdansk Last Judgment and the Lübeck Passion, this is one of the three biggest triptychs that Memling ever painted. The three altarpieces are also distributed evenly throughout his career, and hence serve as crucial milestones in the development of his oeuvre. The St John altarpiece is dated 1479, and is thus located precisely half-way between the Gdansk (1467) and Lübeck (1491) triptychs.The central panel focuses upon a Sacra Conversazione, a gathering of saints around the Virgin. However, the narrow vertical openings between the columns reveal a continuous landscape with ruins and buildings in which small episodes from the lives of the two male saints are enacted. The two wings each depict episodes from the lives of the standing figures of the two St Johns on either side of the Virgin. The left wing features the Beheading of St John the Baptist and the right wing St John the Evangelist on the Island of Patmos. In addition to these realistic portrayals, the carved groups on the two capitals above each saint also depict key moments from their lives.The composition of the triptych as a whole is not only ingenious in narrative terms, with the different components interlocking spatially and thematically; it is also new in many respects as far as the portrayal of the Virgin Mary in heaven and the Apocalypse are concerned. The iconographical forebears of such a grouping of saints sitting and standing around an enthroned Virgin are few and far between. The only extant examples are, in fact, the Virgo inter Virgines from the circle of the Master of Flémalle in Washington and a similar composition, this time set in a room, by Rogier van der Weyden, several fragments of which have survive. They are not, however, comparable in formal terms. This clear monumental composition, with two symmetrical standing male saints and two sitting female saints, forming a tetramorph around the Virgin, must have seemed very new. As is the case with the architecture, Memling appears to have developed here upon Jan van Eyck's Virgin with Canon van der Paele. The Apocalypse is new too. There is no sign of any other representation prior to Memling in which the Book of Revelation is played out before St John's eyes in its entirety in a single, undivided painting. Only in the Beheading of StJohn the Baptist did Memling prefer to paraphrase a Van der Weyden composition (St John altarpiece, Berlin, Staatliche Museen). However, the stylised terseness and enclosed character of the latter give way here to dramatic action in the open air, with a high degree of realism.In view of the historical circumstances and iconography, there can be no doubt whatsoever that this triptych was painted for the High Altar of the chapel of St John's Hospital. An old inscription on the bottom member of the frame gives the date 1479 and the name of the artist Johannes Memling. With the exception of the Floreins triptych in the same hospital, this is the only work by Memling to be authenticated by an original (in this case subsequently overpainted) inscription. The donors were also identified. Jacob de Ceuninc was initially recorded as a monk at the hospital in 1469-70, and later as bursar from 1488 until his death in 1490. Antheunis Seghers was first mentioned in 1455-56 and appears to have been master from 1461 to 1465, bursar from 1466 to 1468, and then master again from 1469 until his death in 1475. Agnes Casembrood was first recorded in 1445-46, and subsequently appears as prioress from 1459 to 1463, and again from 1469 until her death in 1489. Clara van Hulsen makes her initial appearance in the records in 1427-1428, and died in 1479. Given that these are evidently intended as portraits, the altarpiece must have been ordered before the death of Antheunis Seghers in 1475, which means that its production may logically be linked with the expansion of the chapel's apse in 1473- 74 though we lack details of Jacob de Ceuninc and Clara van Hulsen in those years.The altarpiece is, of course, dedicated to the patron saints of St John's Hospital. The central portrayal of the Virgin might relate to the hospital chapel's long-standing and close links with the chapter of the almost adjacent Church of Our Lady. The two female saints, Catherine and Barbara, were frequently invoked in adversity. Their presence in the hospital context has frequently been explained in terms of their symbolising respectively the contemplative and active life of the hospital's monastic community	MEMLING, Hans	St John Altarpiece	Oil on oak panel, 173,6 x 173,7 cm (central), 176 x 78,9 cm (each wing)	1474-79	religious	Flemish	1451-1500

11324-512delac.jpg	Géricault had inspired in Delacroix his fascination with horses, the emblematic beasts of Romantic painting. But his love of horses was fully satisfied only in Morocco. Thereafter the Arab horses that he had seen and drawn during his voyage constituted a kind of repertoire. For one of his last paintings, Arab Horses Fighting in a Stable, he drew on a scene that he had witnessed in Tangier, when the horses of Mornay and the English Consul were fighting. No anatomical studies lie behind this painting. Once again, it is the violence of the combat that he portrays; the power and energy of the animals, an effect emphasised by the strong contrasts of light and shade	DELACROIX, Eug?ne	Arab Horses Fighting in a Stable	Oil on canvas, 64,6 x 81 cm	1860	genre	French	1801-1850

40370-2battle.jpg	This is the central panel of the three paintings representing the battle won by Florence against Siena allied with Visconti, the ruling family of Milan. It took place on June 1st 1432 in San Romano, half way between Florence and Pisa. The picture shows the conclusive combat between the captains of the two armies: Niccol&#242; da Tolentino unseating Bernardino della Ciarda.Uccello's obsession with displaying his mastery of perspective (such as the long white and red lances or the exceptional horses that have rolled over on the ground) and the dramatic nature of the clash between the knights combine with his almost magical story telling. This is underpinned by the use of unreal colours and light as if describing some fabulous tale of chivalrous adventure	UCCELLO, Paolo	Bernardino della Ciarda Thrown Off His Horse	Tempera on wood, 182 x 220 cm	1450s	historical	Italian	1401-1450
20127-anaemic.jpg	Van Hoogstraten's most concentrated period of genre painting production occurred only during the last years of his career, around 1670&#151;71. These later pictures exhibit limited subject matter focusing primarily upon domestic themes. Especially fascinating is his Anaemic Lady (and its pendant of Two Women by a Cradle, dated 1670, Museum of Fine Arts, Springfield). In the Anaemic Lady a taciturn physician examines a flask containing the urine of an ailing young woman while another man (her husband?) looks on. This event takes place in a well-appointed house; the recession of space through two rooms in the background allows the viewer to scrutinize some very interesting paintings hanging on the walls and a sliver of a brilliantly illuminated gilt-leather wall-hanging. The inclusion of gilt-leather wall-hangings (an expensive decorative accouterment at this time), costly paintings, and sumptuous fabrics enhances the aura of opulence exuded by the painting	HOOGSTRATEN, Samuel van	The Anaemic Lady	Oil on canvas, 70 x 55 cm	1660s	genre	Dutch	1651-1700
11211-1890s_06.jpg	After 1880 Degas also explored the theme of women bathing. French artists devoted a significant part of their work to the praise of woman's beauty, albeit less in the nineteenth than in the eighteenth century. Unlike to his predecessors, Degas describes intimate scenes without intimacy, bodies without sensuality. The women bathing, washing, drying themselves, combing their hair or having it combed, are mainly seen from behind. They do not seem to heed the intimacy of the boudoir or bathroom scene. Degas's matter-of-fact depictions of woman was criticized by his contemporaries	DEGAS, Edgar	Nude Stepping into a Bathtub	Pastel, 29 x 25 cm	1895-1900	genre	French	1851-1900

10233-1venus06.jpg	The provenance of this picture is unknown. It is one of a series of paintings in various sizes, representing Venus or a female nude, turned out in quantities by Cranach and his studio; these were popular among the clientele of humanists for whom he worked. However, this conception of Venus belongs to a German tradition which derives its inspiration from Gothic art. The juvenile air, the slender forms, the tiny breasts an narrow hips, the rounded forehead, all go to make up the physical characteristics of the women (including the Virgins) represented in German art since the fourteenth century. This is quite unlike the conception of Dürer's Eve (1504), which was based on an objective and scientific study of the proportions of the human body. The strange pirouetting movements of the legs, crossed over one another, occurs frequently in the engravings of Master E.S. As indicated in the romances and the books of sermons, a swaying walk was one of the ways of expressing worldly elegance for women of this Gothic world from the fourteenth century; but here this Gothic mannerism meets and contributes to another kind - the 'Mannerism' of art history. Mannerist painters and sculptors, whether Italian, German, or French, all admired what Italian aestheticians called 'la linea serpentina', which seemed to them the most beautiful of all forms.The Venus is clad only in a provocatively transparent veil; in some paintings this is a subsequent addition, but here it is original. The better to set off the ivory whiteness of her body, Cranach has shown it silhouetted against a sombre background of foliage. The landscape conveys in a few strokes an intense impression of the Germanic conception of nature.

39709-1ferra1.jpg	"In 1516 Titian made contact with Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara for whom he was to work for a decade on pictures destined for the Alabaster Chamber. In this period he painted a series of magnificent paintings of Dionysian themes: the Worship of Venus in the Prado, The Andrians (Bacchanalia), also in the Prado, and Bacchus and Ariadne, in the National Gallery, London. In these paintings Titian combines a richness of colouristic expression with a great formal elegance. These are the elements which characterize this whole so-called ""classic"" phase of Titian's development and which is dominated by the supreme masterpiece of the Frari Assumption of the Virgin.The first painting in this series is The Worship of Venus, whose subject is Love as the source of fertility and regeneration in nature. Titian's composition is based on a description by the late antique writer Philostratus, in his 'Imagines', of a painting of cupids gathering apples in the presence of Venus amid a tree-girt landscape. By basing himself on Philostratus, Titian was in effect recreating a lost masterpiece of antiquity. This would have flattered the patron, who could thus compare himself to Alexander the Great, the patron of Apelles, the most celebrated painter of the ancient world"	TIZIANO Vecellio	The Worship of Venus	Oil on canvas, 172 x 175 cm	1516-18	mythological	Italian	1501-1550

40245-0view.jpg	"The Salone dei Mesi (Room of Months) in the Palazzo Schifanoia, one of the masterpieces of Italian palace architecture, was decorated with a series of allegorical frescoes symbolizing the months. The length of the room  is 24 m, the width 11 m and the height 7,5 m. The frescoes are attributed to Cosmè Tura, Francesco del Cossa, Baldassare d'Este and Ercole de' Roberti.On the southern wall January and February, on the eastern wall March, April and May, on the north wall June, July, August and September, on the west wall October, November and December were represented. Due to negligence it was in a very bad state already in the 18th century. Today there remained only fragments of the frescoes on the southern and western walls, while those on the eastern wall and most on the northern are in relatively good condition. This means that the visitor can view the surviving allegories of seven months (March, April, May, June July, August and September). In all allegories the episodes are arranged in a three-tiered, frieze-like manner; in the upper sphere, the sphere of mythology, each month and its planet are paralleled by their ancient divinity in a triumphal procession. The middle layer shows the signs of the zodiac, while below are rendered the courtly events appropriate to the particular time of year.This view of the Salone dei Mesi in the Palazzo Schifanoia shows, from the left to the right, frescoes of the months of September, August, July, June, May, April, and May, respectively. The decoration was commissioned by Borso d'Este. The name Borso gave to this pleasure palace means ""away with boredom."	TURA, Cosm?

22806-banksein.jpg	"Loiseau was a self-taught painter who experimented with pointillism around 1884. He sojourned in Pont-Aven, and then, on his many travels, painted landscapes, mainly featuring rivers and the coast. He was dubbed ""the historian of the Seine"" because he was adept at what Impressionism was best suited to: recording and celebrating shifting conditions of light and the changes made in the landscape by human hand"	LOISEAU, Gustave	Banks of the Seine	Oil on canvas, 65 x 82 cm	1902	landscape	French	1851-1900

09645-battle_s.jpg	This painting shows a characteristic battle scene by the artist. The overall setting, in which a military commander and his entourage are depicted in the right foreground, with a mass of soldiers arranged in a circular arc attacking a fortified building in the left background, appears to have been a popular compositional formula for the artist. The battle represented here is not yet identified. Perhaps the scene represents the fall of Jerusalem to the Roman general Popeye (in late autumn 63 BC).

16713-lange1ve.jpg	Girodet was Jacques-Louis David's favourite pupil. The sense of the mysterious and poetic that he shows in many of his works is what many call the Romantic spirit, although it was already latent in Neoclassicism. Girodet sensed the coming direction in an early stage, although he had been trained to be a Neoclassicist by David.Girodet depicted the actress Mademoiselle Lange as Venus, standing on her couch, her face turned from the viewer. In the mirror that Cupid is holding up to her, the painter, who delighted in hidden references, has shown only one ear. When the actress expressed her annoyance at the painting, Girodet painted her again, this time in mythological form, Mademoiselle Lange as Dana&#235;.The toilet of Venus is a timeless theme of sensuous seduction.

20342-landscap.jpg	This painting depicts a landscape with travellers in a horse drawn carriage and figures conversing by a track.

42298-0802vela.jpg	"""Las Meninas"" is a Portuguese word used to name the Maids of Honour of the Royal children in the 17th century.Las Meninas or The Royal Family is one of the great problem pictures in the history of art. An almost infinite number of interpretations have now been proposed for the scene it shows. At first sight, however, Las Meninas seems to present no problems at all, and indeed appears perfectly straightforward in its sober geometry and good-humoured clarity.It is set in a room in the Alcázar, equipped by Velázquez as a studio, and shows the heiress to the throne, the Infanta Margarita, with her court. Palomino names all those present. The queen's maid of honour, Dona Maria Agustina Sarmiento, one of the meninas, is kneeling at the Infanta's feet, handing her a jug of water. The other maid of honour, Dona Isabel de Velasco stands behind the princess, and beside her we see the grotesquely misshapen female dwarf Mari-Bárbola and the male dwarf Nicolasico Pertusato; the latter, as Palomino points out, is placing his foot on the mastiff lying in front of the group to demonstrate the lethargic animal's good temper. Further back, almost swallowed up in the shadows, are a man described only as guardadamas - a guard or escort to the ladies - and the lady in waiting Do&#241;a Marcela de Ulloa.Velázquez is standing with brush and palette in front of a tall canvas; we can see only the back of it. There are some large pictures hanging on the back wall of the room. Two of them were painted by Velázquez's son-in-law, Mazo, from models by Rubens, and show scenes from Ovid's Metamorphoses, one of them another version of the punishment of Arachne. The princess's parents, the king and queen, appear in a dark frame below these pictures, probably the glass of a mirror. To the right of the mirror, on a flight of steps leading up to a doorway and a brightly lit adjoining room, stands Jose Nieto, the queen's palace marshal.There are several basic questions that have been asked again and again about this picture. What is Velázquez painting on the front of the canvas that is hidden from us? Where did he stand in order to paint the scene and himself in it? What is the source of the image in the mirror - that is, just where in the room must the royal couple have been standing for their reflection to appear? And finally, is there any significance in the fact that the red cross of the Order of Santiago is prominently applied to the artist's clothing?It was long thought that Velázquez was creating a picture without any metaphysical or speculative reference, and was merely recording a fleeting moment in permanent form, as if in a snapshot. According to this theory the subject was no more than an ordinary scene of palace life.A different hypothesis is put forward by art historians, who believe that intellect and keen perspicacity, as well as the artist's eye and hand, were involved in the painting of Las Meninas. The largest number of interpretations have been put forward for the mirror on the back wall, sometimes also thought to be a painted canvas. Much learned industry has also been applied to the question of location: in which room in the palace is this scene taking place? Despite the riddles hidden in the painting of Las Meninas we must not overlook its artistic mastery, particularly as expressed in the figure of the Infanta Margarita surrounded by people of lesser birth. For it was on the princess that the dynastic hopes of the Spanish Habsburgs rested after the death of Prince Baltasar Carlos"	VELÁZQUEZ, Diego Rodriguez de Silva y	Las Meninas or The Family of Philip IV	Oil on canvas, 318 x 276 cm	1656-57	portrait	Spanish	1601-1650

40306-109turnf.jpg	Burning of Parliament is the popular name for the fire which destroyed the Palace of Westminster, the home of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, on 16 October 1834. The blaze, which started from overheated chimney flues, spread rapidly throughout the medieval complex and developed into the biggest conflagration to occur in London since the Great Fire of 1666, attracting massive crowds. The fire lasted for many hours and gutted most of the Palace. Westminster Hall and a few other parts of the old Houses of Parliament survived the blaze and were incorporated into the New Palace of Westminster, which was built in the Gothic style over the following decades	TURNER, Joseph Mallord William	The Burning of the Houses of Lords and Commons, October 16, 1834	Oil on canvas, 92 x 123 cm	1834-35	historical	English	1801-1850
29770-winter.jpg	Despite his relative lack of success in later life, Caspar David Friedrich had a considerable impact on younger landscape painters, both in Dresden and elsewhere in northern Germany.

36286-baptist.jpg	This panel is a free copy after the central panel of a triptych by the Bellini workshop (once in Berlin, Staatliche Museen, destroyed during World War II.)

09781-bentivo.jpg	This signed work is one of most well-known of Lorenzo Costa's artistic production. In the portrait of Bentivoglio there is obviously a sound knowledge of Antonello  Messina's style, but what really dominates is the solidity and sculptural relief of the form, which Costa draws from Venetian painting. This is visible in the sturdy build of the whole figure, the imposing neck, and the well-placed head. Costa, who moved to Bologna from his native Ferrara in 1482, was one of the most interesting and modern exponents of Northern painting in this period	COSTA, Lorenzo the Elder	Portrait of Giovanni II Bentivoglio	Tempera on wood, 55 x 49 cm	c. 1492	portrait	Italian	1451-1500
10950-rest_fli.jpg	Gerard David interpreted with great originality the theme of Rest during the Flight to Egypt. The Virgin and Child are placed in the centre in a landscape. A tiny depiction of the Holy Family on its way to Egypt can be seen in the background on the right.

18242-0603grec.jpg	After a short period of study in Greece, El Greco, one of the most renowned figure in Spanish art, went to Venice in the middle of the sixteenth century, where he worked in Titian's workshop, and where he became familiar with the art of Paolo Veronese, Jacopo Bassano and Tintoretto, as well as works by representatives of the North Italian Mannerist school. Later, in Rome, he was strongly influenced by the work of Michelangelo. By the time he had settled in Toledo around 1576, his art was fully developed. Like most of the painters coming from Italy, he was anxious to enter the service of King Philip II, but the Greek painter's immediacy of passion, ecstatic style, disturbing colours and visionary conceptions did not please the king's academic Italian taste. He was, however, appreciated by the religious orders and the aristocratic patrons of Toledo.The penitent Magdalen must have been painted at the beginning of his years in Toledo because the strong influence of paintings on the same theme by Titian can be observed. The ideal of beauty is still Titian's half-figure pictures of women, but the inner tension of the whole composition and the relation between man and nature already indicate the beginning of Mannerism. The arrangement of the fingers of the right hand is a characteristic feature of El Greco's painting. It is assumed by some critics that the sitter of the painting was Jerónima de las Cuevas, the mistress of the artist	GRECO, El	Mary Magdalen in Penitence	Oil on canvas, 157 x 121 cm	1576-78	religious	Spanish	1551-1600
10952-trompes.jpg	The Baptism of Christ forms the central section of a triptych commissioned by the treasurer of the city of Bruges, Jean Trompes. The wings show the donor's family and patron saints on the inside, and the Virgin and Child and the donor's first wife with St Elizabeth on the outside.Nowhere does the artist demonstrate more clearly both his talents and his limitations. The present scene contains virtually no action. The kneeling figures of John the Baptist and the angel dressed in a sumptuous cope reveal a mutual correspondence in their approximate symmetry and subtly differentiated positions. The panel's central axis is strongly emphasized by the figure of Christ, the dove of the Holy Ghost and the apparition of God the Father.In David's paintings the landscape forming the background to religious scenes takes on the motionless and precious look of something whose serenity opposes it to the tragedy of what is happening in the picture. One has only to look at the forest in the background of the Baptism of Christ, with its huge ivy-covered trunks, the strong rhythm of its escarpments and its foliage standing out against the blue of the distance. The still life of flowers in the foreground is characterized by a dazzling wealth of minute detail.This altarpiece was at one time considered one of the best works of Memling. The study of its wing panels was rightly recommended to landscape painters as the work of a marvellous painter of foliage	DAVID, Gerard	Triptych of Jean Des Trompes (central)	Oil on wood, 127,9 x 96,6 cm	1505	religious	Flemish	1501-1550
29335-interior.jpg	Many of Naiveu's later works depict the performing of plays or as here, a scene from a play. The dramas depicted in Naiveu's theatrical pictures are seldom identifiable. In this picture the man entering to the right carries over his arm the costume of a Harlequin, or the Commedia dell'Arte figure of Arlecchino. Although the room depicted is arranged as a theatre set, it is probably not a literal depiction of the enactment of a play before an audience	NAIVEU, Matthijs	Interior with an Elegant Lady Receiving a Suitor	Oil on canvas, 55 x 65 cm	c. 1695	genre	Dutch	1651-1700

On the left, we can see into the Bardi Chapel and can make out the vault with its representations of the Franciscan virtues; to the right, in the Peruzzi chapel we can see the scenes from the life of St John the Evangelist.

26692-lu02jac.jpg	"""Matthan begat Jacob. Jacob begat Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ."" (Matthew 1:15-16)At the top of the entrance wall of the chapel, to the right of the viewer, next to the Eleazar-Matthan lunette, there is the one concluding the genealogical sequence of the ancestors of Christ in the Gospel of St Matthew.Sullen and perplexed, wrapped in a huge yellow ochre cloak and seemingly withdrawn, the old man - generally believed to be Jacob - dominates the family group on the left due to his expressive power and the quality of the colour. Similarly, on the right, the female figure, usually thought to be Mary, is more prominent than the other members of the Holy Family and the child holding a mirror. Behind Mary in the shadow, Joseph holds the Christ child, who stretches out an arm toward the round mirror held out at the height of his face by a naked female child, possibly an allegory of the Church.The compositional schemes of the two neighbouring lunettes correspond: in both there is a female figure in the foreground seen in full, or half, profile and facing the outer wall of the chapel, and a male figure, on the internal side, with his torso seen frontally."

03271-trustgod.jpg	Bartolini would often attempt symbolic religious themes. The most notable of these is Trust in God, which the artist intended as a personification of faith. The nudity of the adolescent figure was meant to represent the human soul placing its trust in the Lord, but much of the sculpture's appeal doubtless stems from its undertone of eroticism.The statue was commissioned from Bartolini by Rosa Trivulzio Poldi Pezzoli. It was an immediate success, highly praised by critics	BARTOLINI, Lorenzo	Trust in God	Marble, height 93 cm	1833	religious	Italian	1801-1850

15570-3annunci.jpg	At the height of the Presentation of the Virgin and the Marriage of Mary - above the corner of the chapel and connecting with the rear wall next to the Gothic window - there is the narrow fresco the Annunciation.Again Ghirlandaio has moved the scene of this biblical event to Tuscany and his own era. He was able to find the traditional Renaissance form of a painted window with a view of a landscape in many Florentine palaces. They can still be seen today in Florence, examples being the palaces of the Medici, Ruccelai and Strozzi families. The angel is derived from the Annunciation painted by the young Leonardo da Vinci between 1472 and 1475, now on view in the Galleria degli Uffizi.In contrast to Leonardo's horizontal format, in Ghirlandaio's fresco in the predetermined vertical format his Virgin may be depicted facing the observer in an equally frontal view, but she is standing upright. She is therefore reminiscent of the beautiful picture on the same theme by Lorenzo di Credi, an artist who was also taught by Verrocchio together with Leonardo and Ghirlandaio	GHIRLANDAIO, Domenico	Annunciation	Fresco	1486-90	religious	Italian	1451-1500
31303-triumph.jpg	In Naples, a great part of the finest sculpture of the Quattrocento is Florentine export works by Donatello, Michelozzo, Antonio Rossellino and Benedetto da Maiano. The principal local sculptor is Francesco Laurana. His relief (shown on the picture) on the Triumphal Arch of Alfonso I, reveals him as charming, competent, and to a considerable extent heir to the tradition of Late Gothic realism.In 1453 a triumphal arch built as the entrance to the Castel Nuovo in Naples. This was intended to commemorate the temporary arch that had been erected in front of the cathedral when King Alfonso entered the city in triumph in 1443. Typifying Alfonso's dependence on Spanish staff, the Catalan master Pere Joan (active 1400-58) oversaw the project. Under his direction Pietro da Milano, a Lombard sculptor who had spent his early years working in Ragusa in Dalmatia, supervised the work of at least five master sculptors (including Francesco Laurana) and thirty-three assistants. Sculptural work was allocated to different workers, ensuring a speedy completion of the project.The attic story of this arch is decorated by a relief of The Triumphal Entry of Alfonso into Naples. In this relief, groups of figures, all carefully coordinated in size and scale, even though carved by different hands, enact an idealized and simplified version of Alfonso's triumphal entry into Naples a decade earlier. The sculptors evoke the character and decorum of early Roman imperial reliefs in the proud, calm bearing of nobles who process behind Alfonso, enthroned and elevated on a canopied processional cart, and in the more active figures of the musicians and horsemen who lead the way	PIETRO DA MILANO	Alfonso of Aragon in Triumph with his Court	Marble, half life-size	1452-58	historical	Italian	1451-1500

To the right above her, Apollo stands in front of his sun-chariot, while in the upper half of the picture we see Jupiter on his throne, Fame with trumpets, as well as putti and other divinities. Below the Spanish monarchy, the personification of Ancient Castilia, the most important Spanish province, appears with a tower, below that are Venus and Mars, while the meeting of the Continents Europe and Africa at Spanish Gibraltar is symbolized at the bottom left by tHe pillars of Hercules	TIEPOLO, Giovanni Battista	The Apotheosis of the Spanish Monarchy	Fresco, 1500 x 900 cm	1762-66	mythological	Italian	1701-1750
21863-amorous.jpg	Pastoral scenes with amorous couples were popular in seventeenth-century Holland.

19658-campovac.jpg	The present painting is one of a handful of cityscapes Jacob de Heusch painted, much influenced by his fellow countryman, the vedutiste Caspar van Wittel. This impressive view of the Roman Forum is a rare topographical representation of the city by the artist. The painter's lively combination of contemporary figures in a topographically accurate setting was typical of the type of views of the city eagerly sought by both Italian collectors and visiting Grand Tourists.Here de Heusch depicts the busy daily life of the Roman Forum, known as the 'Campo Vaccino' since the end of the sixteenth century due to the herds of cows that grazed there.

35015-pieta.jpg	It is already clear in this, his first definitely dated work, that Girolamo Romanino, like Lotto and Savoldo, was reluctant to enter fully into the tradition of Venetian figurative art. The panel was painted for the Chapel of the Holy Passion in the old church of San Lorenzo in Brescia and in it we can see Romanino's predilection for Titian's sonorously rich colour transposed onto a plane of popular narrative strengthened by a romantic, imaginative pathos. Against the background of a landscape which itself seems constricted in its atmosphere of profound anguish, the figures of the foreground seem to float to the surface in sharply cadenced groupings painted in timbres of a blazing quality. The influence of Lombard style which can be noted in the roundish faces painted after the fashion of Bramante, are accompanied by the influence of Northern European painting which can be seen in the view of the town glimpsed through the steamy, stormy atmosphere, in the objective quality of the portrait of the man, in the expressionistic deformation of the little human figures moving around the crosses at Golgotha.In this earliest attributable work by Romanino, the characteristic quality of the artist's style is already evident: an expressionistic realism which seems to offer an extremely personalized reflection of the political, social and religious crises that shook the Western world in the first half of the sixteenth century	ROMANINO, Girolamo	Piet?

09907-courb411.jpg	Courbet's marine scenes were often painted at Étretat, a Norman fishing village popular among artists of his generation and, later, the Impressionists. Its great cliffs, rising so precipitously from the beach and from the waters provided a striking contrast to sand-bound or storm-tossed boats below, and with the ever-changing sea and sky. Courbet painted many views of this site in the late 1860s and early 1870s. This painting stress a rock formation known as Aval or Aiouille, where a natural flying buttress appears to support an equally natural, crenellated tower. This sense of implicit architecture suggests a great city lost in primeval times	COURBET, Gustave	Cliffs at Étretat	Oil on canvas, 66 x 82 cm	1870	landscape	French	1851-1900
12322-8windsor.jpg	The painting is a portable triptych of a type that was fairly widely produced in Italy during the early fourteenth century, essentially for private worship. For the purposes of travel the wings would have closed inwards covering the centre panels and lying flush with the raised spandrel above the inner moulding. The backs of the wings were most probably painted with imitation marble or porphyry, perhaps with decorative motifs, as opposed to narrative scenes. The creation of a work of art of this kind was due to a combination of craftsmanship and painterly skills. Some of the finest surviving examples are Florentine or Sienese in origin. The triptych in the Royal Collection is comparable with examples in the National Gallery in London, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, the Pinacoteca in Siena, and the Fogg Art Museum in Cambridge, Massachusetts, all of which, according to varying degrees of attribution, are associated with Duccio or his workshop.The exact attribution of the present triptych is unsettled owing to the multiplicity of hands at work not only in Duccio's workshop as a whole, but even on the surface of individual paintings. The centre panel in particular is of a quality worthy of Duccio himself. The same might almost be said of the lower scenes in each of the wings, certainly in their design even if the actual execution reveals evidence of assistants (for example, the gold decoration on the cloth of honour behind Christ and the Virgin Enthroned, lower right). The inconsistencies apparent in the architecture of Annunciation (top left) or the design of the two thrones are not unknown in Duccio's own work, as revealed in the Maest&#224; of 1308-11 (Siena, Museo dell'Opera del Duomo) with which this triptych is comparable in date or possibly slightly earlier.The iconography of the panels is also significant. Paradoxically, the inner religious consistency is derived from the unusual combination of scenes, especially the pairing of enthroned figures in the lower sections of the wings. The enthronement of the Virgin twice (lower left and lower right), for instance, suggests a temporal sequence before and after Christ's death as represented in the centre. The Annunciation (top left) is comparable with the relevant scene (now in the National Gallery, London) from the Maest&#224;, whereas both Saint Francis receiving the Stigmata (top right) and Christ and the Virgin Enthroned (lower right) recall frescoes in the Upper Church of St Francis, Assisi (the former in the nave from the Life of Saint Francis and the latter, earlier in date and by Cimabue, in the transept). These connotations and the treatment of the crucifixion in a devotional, as opposed to a narrative sense, imply a Franciscan origin for this triptych. The quantity of blood depicted in the central scene (some of it removed in an earlier restoration) is an unusual feature in a work on this scale.Probably before it became part of the Royal Collection the triptych had been dismantled and put in a heavy gothic frame, which was removed when it was cleaned in 1930. After this the triptych was displayed in a shadow box with a simpler frame. This, too, was considered to be inappropriate and the present reconstruction of the triptych was devised in 1988, although further thought has since been given to the angle at which the two wings should be positioned in order to make proper visual sense of the architecture.

23175-13monaco.jpg	This panel formed part of a predella, which included a Visitation (Courtauld Galleries, London), a Nativity (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), an Adoration of the Magi (Courtauld Galleries, London), and a Flight into Egypt (Lindenau-Museum, Altenburg).The oblong frame, with a semicircle on every corner and angular projections between them, divides the picture into three parts and Lorenzo Monaco made good use of the possibilities offered by the unusual shape of the frame. He placed the Virgin and her Child-isolated from the other figures-into the central, widest part. The Virgin is riding the ass side-saddle, as though she were sitting on a throne, and she is turned towards us. To indicate the direction of her course, her body is a little bent backwards. The oblique line of her body suggests a straight line between the upper point of the frame and the bottom inward angle on the right, and this diagonal axis is further stressed by the ass's foreleg, stepping forwards, which, continuing the same line, eventually ends in the semicircle. A similar connection between the composition and the frame can be observed in the hindmost leg of the ass and the bottom left semicircle. The oblique line of the leg is a reflected image of the axis which was mentioned previously. The horizontal line of the animal's body links the figures of the Virgin and Joseph, and, at the same time, it separates the Holy Family from the women accompanying them. The palm branches in the hands of the woman in a green cloak, and the drapery falling downwards from her arm, practically creates a line between the top and the bottom angular indentations of the frame. (According to some apocryphal gospels the fleeing Holy Family was nourished by the fruits of a palm-tree bending towards them.) The background, too, separates the left-hand side of the picture from the rest: the escorts proceed among bare, grey rocks, while the Holy Family move through woods: the foliage magically illuminates the semi-darkness.Whilst the two female figures are moving forwards, Joseph, at the head of the small group, has stopped and looks back. By this the painting representing progress in one direction becomes enclosed and symmetrical. This geometrically constructed composition with its strict rhythm by Lorenzo Monaco shows, as do all his works, that even while pursuing the best trecento traditions of Florentine art, an artist could adjust himself to the International Gothic style. Counterparts of the two women, with the long, even and soft folds of their draperies, or of the Virgin's graceful, aristocratic figure, could be found anywhere in the art of the period. On the other hand, the vigorous and definite personality of Joseph can be imagined only in Florentine art, which had old, democratic traditions. In vain would we try to find this image in the representations of Joseph as the humble old man in Northern art	LORENZO Monaco	The Flight into Egypt	Tempera on poplar, 24 x 39 cm (with frame)	1405-10	religious	Italian	1401-1450
15209-david.jpg	Orazio Gentileschi's brooding image of David contemplating the head of Goliath reflects a new type of meditative image introduced at the beginning of the seventeenth century by Caravaggio. Traditionally David was shown either as an uncompromised biblical hero slaying Goliath or as a triumphant youth displaying the giant's decapitated head. In Caravaggio's David with the Head of Goliath (Galleria Borghese, Rome), which was likely to have been sent from Naples around 1609 as a gift for Cardinal Scipione Borghese, the adolescent hero gazes tenderly at his victim's head, creating a strong, almost erotic, bond. Orazio's David does not interact with Goliath's head, rather he stands beside it lost in a moment of deep introspection, evoking a pensive atmosphere similar to the mood generated in Caravaggio's St John the Baptist. Like the St John, David's body is pushed towards the picture plane and set off against a background of dense, dark foliage. This verdant background is strikingly different from the one in Orazio's small copper version (Gem&#228;ldegalerie, Berlin), in which David is framed by a rocky cliff. The difference has led some critics to suggest that Agostino Tassi was responsible for the landscape in the Spada picture, but there is no conclusive proof to substantiate this.Unlike the Berlin copper, where David is seen full-length, in the Spada version his body is cropped just below the knee and Goliath's head is turned upwards towards the viewer. It has been suggested that the Spada canvas was cut down at the bottom. However, technical evidence shows that instead it was extended on all four sides. Thus the picture would have focused more directly on the contemplative and melancholic David and the head of Goliath would have appeared to rest on the edge of the frame. A copy of the Berlin composition (Quadreria Arcivescovile, Milan) was paired with a version of Artemisia Gentileschi's Judith Beheading Holofernes , but there is no evidence to indicate that two pictures of such contrasting moods were originally conceived as pendants.

17983-07scene.jpg	"The Preaching to the Birds and Blessing Montefalco took place in Umbria. The precise topographical description of the places is noticeable. In the middle distance a view of the Umbrian town of Bevagna can be seen, near to which the preaching to the birds is supposed to have taken place. The mighty Monte Subasio, with a little church half way up, and a view of the town of Assisi, form the background. In the background on the left, at the foot of the table mountain, lies Assisi with the fortress and magnificent monastery church of San Francesco that was not built until after St Francis' death. The topography of the cities is also in accordance with reality: Assisi lies to the north west of Montefalco.The preaching Francis is pointing upwards to indicate that he is speaking about God. The 13 different kinds of birds, including a hoopoe, a swan, a thrush, a magpie, a pheasant and a dove, underline by their exceptional, unnatural gathering the godliness of the conversation.Almost in the centre of the picture, the saint and his companion appear simultaneously a second time. The two scenes are compositionally separated by the two figures which are seen standing in profile. Not until they reach the background do the two landscapes meet. Various chronological levels become evident in the conscious division of the pictorial space. On the wall the city coat of arms of Montefalco appears.Before St Francis, four men are reverently kneeling. The one in the front is wearing a Franciscan habit and a cap bearing the inscription M. MARCUS. He is holding a bishop's miter in his hands. This might be the ""Master Marcus"" who towards the end of the 14th century was the bishop of Sarsina and later of Marsico Nuovo. Fra Jacopo, who commissioned the work, is the second kneeling Franciscan. The other people are presumably members of the Calvi family, which in the 15th century acted on several occasions as donors for the church of San Francesco in Montefalco.The inscription beneath the picture describes what is taking place: QUANDO B. F. PR(A)EDICAVIT AUIBUS APUD MEUANEUM DEMU(M) BENEDIXIT MO(N)TEM FALONE(M) ET P(O)PULU(M) - ""How St. Francis preached to the birds and then blessed Montefalco and the population."

30681-flowers2.jpg	Pérez Sierra's flower paintings were appreciated by some of the most distinguished collectors of his time, including the king himself. On the death of Charles II, the 1700 inventory of the Buen Retiro palace mentioned a series of six flower pieces by his hand, of which four are known today, the painting shown here is one of them. These works show the distinctive personality of this artist in the genre. Their low viewpoint endows the flower pieces with a degree of monumentality and reflects the fact that they were conceived for display over windows or doors, or another such high point on a wall.

08664-13nurse.jpg	The Attentive Nurse, or the Nourishment of Convalescence, as it was described in the Salon catalogue of 1747, is one of Chardin's most refined and exquisitely finished paintings. The scene depicts a nurse who is evidently preparing a meal for an invalid. While the delicacy of the treatment is typical of eighteenth century, the choice of a genre subject shows the influence of seventeenth century Dutch domestic scenes, which Chardin studied in his youth.At the Salon of 1747 it was exhibited together with a companion piece. It is debated whether the other painting was the Kitchen Maid or the Servant Returning from the Market	CHARDIN, Jean-Baptiste-Siméon	The Attentive Nurse	Oil on canvas, 46 x 37 cm	1747	genre	French	1701-1750
31065-2august2.jpg	In 1454 Piero agreed to paint a polyptych for the Augustinians of Borgo San Sepolcro; the painting was to be finished within eight years and was intended for their monastery. As usual, the work was not completed until much later. The polyptych later dismembered and the panels were scattered. It was only in the twentieth century that scholars succeeded in reconstructing this work. Among the parts of the polyptych that have unfortunately not survived there is also the central panel which represented the Virgin Enthroned.St Michael was one of the four side panels depicting four saints (St Augustine and St Michael at the left side and St John the Evangelist and St Nicholas of Tolentino at the right).Archangel Michael is portrayed as an ancient warrior, his athletic limbs made more elegant by his precious armour, by the graceful tunic and by his beautiful boots decorated by with tiny pearls.

41375-06madonn.jpg	This panel, originally attributed to Simone Martini, was discovered in Naples in 1904. As early as 1906 this attribution was already contested and the painting was reassigned to a variety of different painters in the circle of Martini; among them Naddo Ceccarelli, Lippo Memmi, and Donato Martini. At the same time, a number of art historians supported the attribution of the work to Simone Martini.More recently, scholars have agreed in assigning it to a close collaborator of Martini, an anonymous master who takes his eponym from this painting , which was formerly kept in the Palazzo Venezia in Rome (The Master of Palazzo Venezia). This panel was once the central element of a polyptych, to which a St Peter and Mary Magdalene at the National Gallery in London are also considered to have belonged. The reconstruction of the career and artistic personality of this painter has shed light on the artist's exquisite transposition of Simone Martini's formal vocabulary. The dating of the piece has been assigned to some time after the anonymous master's 1333 Annunciation (Uffizi Gallery, Florence), perhaps when Simone had already left for Avignon	UNKNOWN MASTER, Italian	Madonna and Child	Tempera on panel, 73 x 41,5 cm	1330s	religious	Italian	1301-1350
08992-07italia.jpg	The painting is signed and dated: Claude in. f.  Romae 1642. The painting is included in Liber Veritatis (LV 64).A shepherd-couple are placed in the foreground of this southern landscape. The woman is seated on a rock and is listening to the shepherd playing the shawm. To the right of the picture is a tent supported by a tree, and on the left a stone bridge leads to a ruined Roman temple. In the background the open sea is half-obscured by the mist of a warm summer's day.The painter, whose real name was Claude Gellée, was a native of Lorraine. When he first arrived in Rome, he worked as a pastrycook, then as assistant to the landscape painter Agostino Tassi, whom he helped with decorative work. Not much is known about his early career. It was only in his thirties that he began to acquire stature and reputation as an artist in his own right. The German painter-biographer Joachim von Sandrart, reporting on his visit to Rome (1629-35), writes that Claude was determined 'to become familiar with nature in all its forms, and would spend whole days and late into the night in the fields, so that he learned how to convey most naturally the flush of day, the rising and setting of the sun . . .'.Characteristic features of Claude's art are the subtle moods of the landscape and the variation in the seascape with the changing seasons. People are unimportant in his pictures; the painter regarded them only as a means of lending animation to his landscapes and as a rule he did not even paint them himself. In the 1630s he started a book which he gradually filled with pen-and-ink drawings of almost 200 of his own pictures; although it does not comprise his entire oeuvre, it is nevertheless a unique documentary record of his artistic creations. The book is preserved today in the British Museum under the title Liber Veritatis; in it the Berlin landscape features on p. 64, and according to a note written on the verso, the work was commissioned by a patron in Paris.This picture is recorded as having been in English private ownership in the early eighteenth century: until 1722 it was in the possession of the Duke of Portland, who sold it to the Earl of Scarbrough. About 1818 it passed into the possession of Count Pourtalès and from him, in 1865, into the collection of the Marquis de la Ganay, from whom Bode bought it in 1881 for the Berlin Gallery	CLAUDE LORRAIN	Italian Coastal Landscape	Oil on canvas, 97 x 131 cm	1642	landscape	French	1651-1700

09602-day.jpg	The painting was probably cut down slightly on the sides and top, painted originally for a local church at the same time that he was working on the frescoes in the Cathedral. It can be considered as the companion of the Nativity (The Night) in Dresden.Considered his masterpiece among the altarpieces, the composition is built up as a remote variation of the pyramidal arrangements favoured by Leonardo, broken by the dominating verticality of St Jerome on the left. The sacra conversazione is transformed into an informal and incidental narrative that takes place in a landscape. A makeshift red canopy has been constructed in the foreground, where his figures are massed on a compact, constricted plane. Their poses are particularly hard to reconstruct because they are either figures covered by draperies that effectively hide their structure, or are in intricate unnatural positions. As Correggio grew older, he began to take liberties with the conventions regarding the proportion of figures. Saint Jerome on the left, accompanied by his identifying lion, occupies almost the entire height of the painting, assuming a dominant role even in relation to the Madonna and Child. His thick, muscular right leg is strikingly long in comparison to his upper body and rather smallish head.The pictorial effects derive from a masterly application of the oil paint, confident and elegant colour, and idealized, refined faces	CORREGGIO	Madonna and Child with Sts Jerome and Mary Magdalen (The Day)	Oil on panel, 235 x 141 cm	1525-28	religious	Italian	1501-1550

26005-02last4.jpg	The closed altarpiece shows the donor and his wife kneeling in prayer, each before a niche containing respectively a statue of the Virgin and Child and St Michael battling with demons. Their escutcheons are mounted on the polygonal base of the niches. These were identified as belonging to the Florentines Angelo di Jacopo Tani (1415-1492) and Caterina di Francesco Tanagli (1446-1492). Tani was an agent of the Medici bank in Bruges in 1450, before becoming its manager in 1455. He was ousted by Tommaso Portinari in 1465. Tani married in Florence in 1466, and his wife bore a daughter (one of several) on 8 June 1471. He drew up his will on 12 December 1467, the same month as he was sent back north to save the London branch from bankruptcy. The holy figures represented here evidently relate first and foremost to the devotion of the donors. The coats-of-arms were originally reversed - in other words, the man's arms appeared in the woman's panel, and vice versa.Before departing for London in December 1467, Tani founded a chapel dedicated to St Michael at his employer's church in Fiesole and drew up his will. He probably also made funeral arrangements in the customary manner. He will then have required an altarpiece, which he ordered from Memling some time after the end of 1467 during his stay in the north. The painting was, therefore, largely executed during his stay in London between 1467 and 1469, from where he could monitor its progress. The iconography of the altarpiece is clarified by its destination. St Michael has been selected here first and foremost as the saint to whom the chapel was dedicated, and only in the second place as Tani's patron. This also explains the absence of the woman's patron.

Her inclusion in the present work perhaps indicates that the panel was commissioned by a patron from Chiusi.The present work is a rare signed example by Cola.

10756-apocalyp.jpg	After attending the drawing school of the Royal Dublin Society and spending a brief period in London, Danby settled around 1813 for two decades in Bristol, in whose environs he painted the small, exquisite landscapes on which his fame today largely rests. Forced to leave England in 1829 due to financial problems and a marital scandal, Danby established himself in Paris and Geneva, where he remained until 1840. His oils, ink drawings, and watercolours, focussing on lyrically romantic landscapes, represents one of the most significant contributions made by any artist to nineteenth-century British landscape painting. He also concerned himself with religious themes, treated in a visionary manner.The present painting is presumably one of four depicting scenes from the Apocalypse. In a Romantic nocturnal landscape evoking the infinity of the cosmos appears a vision of the giant angel described in Chapter 10 of the Apocalypse, descending in a cloud from heaven with a rainbow over his head and legs like columns of fire. The natural scene in which the visionary apparition is set evinces a coloration and sophisticated painterly handling that explain Danby's rank as one of the finest British landscapists of the nineteenth century	DANBY, Francis	Scene from the Apocalypse	Oil on canvas, 61 x 77 cm	c. 1829	mythological	Irish	1801-1850
32435-antioch.jpg	This early painting by Preti is notable for its rare literary subject and clear stylistic allusion to Paolo Veronese. The subject of this picture is taken from Torquato Tasso's Gerusalemme liberata (1580). The heroine Erminia inscribed his lover Tancred's name on every tree and branch. The choice of subject matter was doubtless inspired by Pietro da Cortona and Nicolas Poussin, both of whom had painted stories from Tasso in Venetian influenced styles	PRETI, Mattia	Erminia, Princess of Antioch	Oil on canvas, 98 x 73 cm	c. 1640	mythological	Italian	1651-1700

31000-ecstasy.jpg	This is among Piazzetta's finest paintings and is also a masterpiece of eighteenth-century sacred art. The altarpiece (which was originally in the church of S. Maria d'Aracoeli in Vicenza) is composed along three parallel diagonals that cut across the composition from left to right. The most important section is in the centre where Piazzetta contrasts the luminous and robust figure of the wonderful angel with the lifeless, dark, and heavy figure of the fainting saint. The descriptive detail (such as the scruffy wooden structure or the figure of Brother Leo with his back to us) accentuate the feeling of isolation and intense mysticism.

17191-cypres02.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 613, JH 1746.This painting was executed in June 1889 after the beginning of his voluntary confinement at the asylum of Saint Paul in Saint-Rémy. The loaded brushstrokes and the swirling, undulating forms are typical of the artist's late work.Living in the asylum in Saint-Rémy, van Gogh repeatedly turned his attention to the no-man's-land between the wide world out there and his own confined world. When he looked across the low wall that enclosed the asylum, he found a whole world of subjects awaiting him. There was a range of hills, the Alpilles, with countless olive trees at their feet and an occasional solitary cypress crowning them to counteract the gentle ups and downs of the hills with a bold vertical.The immense cypresses in this painting are seen so close that the top of one is cropped by the upper edge of the picture.

14397-st_bruno.jpg	St Bruno was canonised in 1623, and so appeared frequently at that time in paintings from throughout southern Europe.Le Puy is the capital of the Haute Loire, part of a large upland area, the Massif central, in the southern central region of France. The large number of Romanesque churches in and around the town bear testimony to the fact that it flourished in the Middle ages. It was never an area noted for painting activity, and the return of Guy François from Rome to his native region was therefore to be of great significance in local terms, much more so than similar events in other centres where there was more than one painter active. Guy François was to work in isolation for more than thirty years, gradually diluting his art as memories of what he had learned in Rome faded. The pictures that he painted in France nearly all remain in and around Le Puy.It is only in recent years that the Italian period of Guy François has been reconstructed and his Italian pictures disentangled from the work of Carlo Saraceni. Saraceni, a difficult artist to define, was essentially eclectic, with an unusual skill in brushwork almost akin to that of a northerner. He assimilated many influences, ranging from Caravaggio to the German ERlsheimer.The picture by François that most shows the influence of Saraceni is the Holy Family with St Bruno and St Elisabeth, now in the Musée de l'Ain at Bourg-en-Bresse. Like much of François's work, it was intended as a large altarpiece. His altarpieces that survived in the Le Puy area, in the churches for which they were painted, are often surrounded by a provincial version of a sculptured and stuccoed framework in the Italian Baroque style. Although commonplace in Italy, such pictures in situ are rare in France; most seventeenth century altarpieces by the major painters are now in museums. The Holy Family altarpiece has the simplified forms sometimes found in works by Saraceni and also the strong lighting suitable for a prominent position in a church, where the picture would normally be seen from a distance.The strength of some of Guy François' compositions has led some authorities to suggest that he was influenced by Nicolas Tournier, but the most likely explanations for their superficial similarity are that both artists brought back from Italy similar Caravaggesque influences, and that both of them were forced to rely on what they had experienced and learned without renewed contact with their sources. Both painter had a predilection for monumental scale, although François never achieved Tournier's dramatic intensity. Instead he provided, in an area isolated from all artistic contact, a whole group of soundly painted and striking altarpieces	FRANÇOIS, Guy	Holy Family with St Bruno and St Elisabeth	Oil on canvas, 210 x 153 cm	-	religious	French	1601-1650
22761-ecstasy.jpg	In his second Epistle to the Corinthians, St Paul describes the revelations that were made to him. Liss portrays one of the apostle's visions, `how that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter'. Above the seated apostle, who is surrounded by books, an angel draws aside a curtain; terrified, Paul shrinks back from the expanse of heaven revealed to him. Angels playing musical instruments gambol in the clouds, and in the distance the Trinity appears. The colours range from the deep violet of Paul's cloak through the green of the curtain to the most delicate yellow, blue and pink of the clouds. This painting with its extraordinary wealth of brilliant colour is one of the artist's finest works and seems to anticipate the Venetian painting of the eighteenth century.With the exception of Adam Elsheimer, Johann Liss was the most outstanding German painter of the seventeenth century. He was born in Schleswig-Holstein c. 1597, spent several years studying in the Netherlands, where he came into contact with the Haarlem painters, principally Goltzius and Buytewech, and with the Flemish followers of Caravaggio in Antwerp (Janssens, Jordaens). Liss then made his way to Italy via Paris. To begin with, he worked in Rome, where he was a member of the Netherlandish artists' colony, and exactly when he settled in Venice is not known. Until his early death, supposedly a victim of the plague which broke out in 1629, he continued to work in Venice and it was in these last years that he produced his best-known works, among them The Ecstasy of St Paul. Together with Domenico Feti, Liss played an important part in reviving the use of rich colours, a Venetian tradition which had ended with Tintoretto.In the seventeenth century this painting was in the famous collection of the Amsterdam merchant Gerrit Reynst (died 1658), which consisted mainly of works by Venetian masters and included a companion-piece, The Vision of St Peter, which was subsequently lost. Both pictures were engraved by Jeremias Falck and attributed to Johann Liss, but it seems certain that the St Peter picture was not the work of Liss but of Domenico Feti, who was a close friend of the German painter. It may be that after Feti's death (1623), his patron decided to commission Johann Liss to paint the companion-picture to the St Peter. The Ecstasy of St Paul came up for sale in Amsterdam in 1722 with the Van de Amory Collection and found its way through a Florentine art-dealer into the Berlin collection of A. von Frey, from which it passed in 1919 to the Picture Gallery	LISS, Johann	The Ecstasy of St Paul	Oil on canvas, 80 x 58 cm	1628-29	religious	German	1601-1650
24032-0sposi1.jpg	The space of the room with a square plan (8,1 x 8,1 m) is essentially a cube, and in it Mantegna has created a monumental architectural reality by means of ribs on the ceiling connecting with pilasters on the walls, which are in turn supported by a marble socle. In the centre of the ceiling is the much-admired oculus, opening onto a painted sky. The interplay of levels of reality elaborates ideas already set forth in his art. Only the corbels are actually stone, the highly worked ribs, the garlands that encircle the eight busts of emperors supported by putti, and the ensembles in decorative lozenges are painted to simulate marble so convincingly that even the modern viewer is sometimes fooled. In the triangular spaces at the edges of the ceiling are twelve mythological scenes of Orpheus, Orion, and Hercules with backgrounds of simulated mosaics, a device that Raphael was to use in the ceiling of the Stanza della Segnatura. Only two of the walls have figurative narrations: the north wall with a scene that is usually called the Court and the west wall, divided into three scenes, Servants with Horse and Dogs, the Inscription with Putti, and the Meeting. The remaining two walls are painted with imitation leather draperies that encroach upon the other sides as well to create the fiction that there were curtains before all four walls and on two sides they had been opened up to reveal the events depicted.The central subject of the frescoes is Ludovico III Gonzaga, his wife, his children, and his court. A closed letter held by Cardinal Francesco Gonzaga in the Meeting seems to be the same one, now opened, that Ludovico, seated majestically, holds in the Court, and must be considered important for understanding the paintings. The style of the frescoes is similar to Mantegna's previous works. The compositions are dominated by the narrative elements, with the figures set frieze-like, close to the picture plane within a narrow spatial shelf in front of a landscape or architectural setting	MANTEGNA, Andrea	View of the west and north walls	Walnut oil on plaster	1465-74	historical	Italian	1451-1500

23142-3pomegra.jpg	The Madonna and Christ Child appear in a window, and the child is standing on the balustrade below it. She is holding a pomegranate that has been cut open out to him, and the boy has taken some of it, for he is showing Mary red pearls of fruit that he is holding in his clumsy child's hand. Mary appears melancholy, as if she knows about the future Passion of her son, symbolized by the pomegranate.This is one of the first Florentine panel paintings known today to have been produced with a paint medium containing oil for colour pigments. This technique first appeared in northern painting in the first half of the 15th century and rapidly spread there. Italian developed the technique later. The panel is very small by Italian standards, yet not at all an unusual format in Flemish painting. The Christ Child as well, with his fat, tummy overlong torso and skinny little arms, refutes the widespread generally more rounded Florentine type of depiction.This Madonna is modeled after one by Leonardo; in fact, the painting was formerly thought to be an early work by Leonardo	LORENZO DI CREDI	Madonna and Child with a Pomegranate	Oil on panel, 16,5 x 13,4 cm	1475-80	religious	Italian	1451-1500

Lodovico's presentation of the narrative discretely includes all the relevant context of the story, without distracting the viewer from the magnificent figure of Peter in the foreground. In the background we see the palace of  the High Priest, with Christ being brought before him on the arcaded upper story, and the servants warming themselves by a fire on the ground arcade, where Peter had recently been with them.

There is real poetry in its vigour, and a delight in the wildness of nature, in towering trees and rich foliage, which makes one regret that this aspect of his art is so rare.

15203-cecilia.jpg	The painting depicts the appearance of an angel to Valerianus and Cecilia, a young couple who had been converted to Christianity. Cecilia had taken a vow of chastity and had persuaded her husband to do likewise. Valerianus had suspected her of secretly being in love with his f riend Tiburtius but the angelic apparition allays his doubts while also heralding their approaching martyrdom.The composition - showing the three sumptuously dressed saints as they express with dignity their astonishment over the apparition of the angel - incorporates the main elements of Gentileschi's art. It represents a high point of his maturity, ranking with the Madonna of the Rosei family and the Annunciation in Turin. The disciplined, orderly construction has a Neoclassical stamp that derives from the artist's Tuscan background. The handling of the light shows the fundamental influence of Caravaggio, while the refinement of the surfaces in the gleaming satin and damask draperies and the soft warmth of the velvets are inspired by Bronzino.Typical of Gentileschi are the arrested gestures standing out against the opaque shadow of the austere interior; the figure of Tibertius, silhouetted against the light as he cautiously peers at the angel; the system of curves formed by the wings, the body and the long palm branch of the angel in flight; and the outstretched arms of St. Cecilia and St. Valerianus. The structural elements of the composition are striking: the link between Tibertius' hand and the angel's foot; the alignment of the palm branch and the organ pipes, and the wreath of flowers, St. Cecilia's hand and St. Valerianus' knee; and the parallels formed by the figures of St. Valerianus and St. Cecilia, the organ pipes and the door frame, the keyboard and the dais. Every element is brought into complex play in this highly articulated composition, from the tips of the wings and the palm branch to the edge of the red mantle, St. Valerianus' foot and the velvet cushion.

14989-2ponta04.jpg	This work was probably produced at the beginning of 1894, when Gauguin painted another snowscape, Paris in the Snow (Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum Van Gogh). During his two years in Paris he painted far fewer works than before - large amounts of his time were taken up with organizing his show at Durand-Ruel's and on a number of literary projects. Consequently, what little he did paint was not new in either subject or treatment. This landscape is remarkably similar to those that he had produced during his Impressionist period - the small brush-strokes are quite different from the broad sweeps of colour that characterized his Tahitian works	GAUGUIN, Paul	Breton Village in the Snow	Oil on canvas, 62 x 87 cm	1894	landscape	French	1851-1900
11595-salome.jpg	Dolci was a painter of intense religiosity. His work was much sought after internationally during his own lifetime and his reputation reached its apogee during the eighteenth century, particularly in England. The meticulous finish, careful elaboration of detail and concentration of expression, especially in those compositions with single figures, are the hallmarks of a style that proved to be influential even in the late eighteenth century in the work, for example, of Jean-Baptiste Greuze.The biblical source for the painting is Matthew 14:6-11 or Mark 6:21-8, where the daughter of Herodias danced for her stepfather, Herod, on his birthday. As a reward he promised her anything she wanted and, prompted by her mother, she chose the head of Saint John the Baptist, which she then carried to Herodias on a silver charger. The daughter subsequently became known in literature as Salome, and the theme was memorably treated in the nineteenth century by Richard Strauss and Oscar Wilde amongst others.Dolci painted several versions of Salome. According to Baldinucci, the original version was painted, probably during the 1660s, for the Marchese Rinuccini in Florence and it proved to be the artists most popular work, known through two other variants of good quality (Dresden, Staatliche Kunstsammlungen and Glasgow, City Museum and Art Gallery), which in turn spawned numerous copies. Of the three versions recorded by Baldinucci, the present painting is the second, which was acquired by Sir John Finch (1626&#151;82) who gave it to Charles II. Finch was the English Resident at the court of the Grand Duke Ferdinand II in Florence from 1665 to 1670.You can view other depictions of Salome with the Head of John the Baptist.

03041-07lamen.jpg	Kneeling beneath the crosses of Calvary, the Virgin mourns her Son whose body lies before her. John supports the dead Christ's head, while Mary Magdalene, her long hair flowing, lifts one of His hands to her cheek. Behind John stands Joseph of Arimathaea with an anointing-vessel, and behind the Virgin rises the upright of the bare cross, stained with the blood of the crucified Saviour; on the tree next to it can be seen the bound foot of one of the thieves. Beyond is a rocky landscape with a castle on the edge of a lake.Apart from the Berlin panel, the theme of the Lamentation occurs in only one other painting by Baldung. The picture in the Landesmuseum at Innsbruck, which bears the date 1513 and is clearly an earlier work, is much more constricted, more angular and restless in its composition. In the Berlin painting the dramatic outburst of grief on the part of John and Mary Magdalene has given way to silent resignation. This simplification of the forms and softening of the outline is also apparent in two drawings on the same theme, a sketch in Basel for the Innsbruck painting, which bears the date 1513, and a drawing in a private collection, which is dated 1515. By studying as well two woodcuts on the same subject, the consistent development of Baldung's style from early apprenticeship to the full maturity of the Berlin Lamentation shows up in a telling manner.The artist, whose family came from Swabia, was born at Weyersheim near Strasbourg. At the age of 18 he began his apprenticeship in Dürer's workshop in Nuremberg. It may have been the patricians of the imperial city who later obtained for him the commission for two altarpieces which he completed around 1507 for Halle Cathedral. One, representing the Adoration of the Magi, eventually found its way to the Berlin Gallery. While in Strasbourg, of which town he had become a burgher in 1509, he received the important commission for the high altar in Freiburg Cathedral, whereupon he moved to Freiburg and spent several years there, roughly between 1512 and 1517. It was only towards the end of the second decade, when he had completed this major work, that Baldung seems to have painted the Lamentation, in which one can detect traces of the imposing Freiburg style, a distinct departure from the late-Gothic resonances of the Innsbruck panel.Hardly anything is known about the origins of this picture. At one time it belonged to a private collector in southern France. Wilhelm Bode bought it and presented it to the Berlin Gallery in 1907	BALDUNG GRIEN, Hans	The Lamentation of Christ	Lime panel, 141,3 x 96 cm	c. 1518	religious	German	1501-1550
31314-altar_1.jpg	This panel belonged to an altarpiece, now dismembered. According to the reconstruction accepted by many scholars, the altarpiece consisted of a Virgin and Child in the centre (Brooklyn Museum, New York), St Augustin (Lindenau-Museum, Altenburg) at the left, and probably St Nicholas (lost) at the right. The three predella panels are the Departure of St Augustin (Staatliche Museen, Berlin), the Entry of Christ to Jerusalem (Pinacoteca Stuard, Parma), and the Birth of St Nicholas (Kunstmuseum, Basel)	PIETRO DI GIOVANNI D'AMBROGIO	Virigin and Child	Tempera and tooled gold on poplar panel, 98 x 53 cm	1435-40	religious	Italian	1401-1450

(Matthew 1:13-14)This is the first lunette on the north wall.The absence of information regarding the figures represented has thwarted any attempt to identify them. On the left a seated woman is shown indicating something outside the lunette to a boy (or a girl) who seems to be engrossed in writing or drawing and turns somewhat hesitantly. The woman's pose, with its great naturalness and self-possession, is a variation on the twisted head, shoulders, and legs of the other figures.On the other side of the lunette, seen sideways on, but with his head turned toward the viewer, sits a solitary mature man, his face furrowed by deep lines. Tightly wrapped in his yellow ochre mantle, from which only his head and an arm emerge, he appears to be prey to distressing thoughts. The body, modelled concisely with great plastic power by the interplay of light and shade, and the pattern of the folds of the mantle, stands out clearly against the background.The number of figures present in this lunette is half that of the first lunettes painted by Michelangelo.

Moses and the Golden Calf is disturbing in its originality because the figures have become increasingly thin, diaphanous, and dependent upon silhouette and outline to achieve convincing form. Scale is unconventional and has little significance by normal usage. Moses, holding the tablets, stands in a contorted pose and looks disapprovingly at the miniaturized golden calf nearby.

11120-early11.jpg	Degas's family were related to the Italian aristocracy, among them Baroness Bellelli and Duchess Morbilli. In 1856 he traveled for the first time to Italy, where he intended to make the acquaintance of his Italian relatives. This journey, which was followed by another in 1858 and several more in 1859, was Degas's real education. In Italy, Degas preferred the Quattrocento painters and the exponents of Florentine Mannerism.The people Degas depicted in that time were almost all members of his family, especially his sisters and brothers, and himself. His early portraits achieve their culmination in his group portrait The Bellelli Family.The present painting represents Hilaire de Gas, the painter's grandfather	DEGAS, Edgar	Hilaire de Gas	Oil on canvas, 53 x 41 cm	1857	portrait	French	1851-1900

09741-grif_02.jpg	The reconstruction of the polyptych, dismembered in the 18th century, is not unambiguous. It seems certain that the central panel was the painting of St Vincent Ferrer while on his sides were St Peter and St John the Baptist. Paintings of St Lucy and St John the Baptist were probably located on the upper part of the sides while a Crucifixion tondo was in the upper central position. The predella was executed by Ercole de' Roberti.	COSSA, Francesco del	Griffoni Polyptych: St Peter and St John the Baptist	Oil on panel, 112 x 55 cm (each)	1473	religious	Italian	1451-1500

14817-certosa2.jpg	The picture shows the lunette fresco in the Tesoro Vecchio in the Certosa di San Martino.Gargiulo worked for the Carthusians in Naples over a period of more than twenty years. He painted the lunette in the so-called Tesoro Vecchio, whose subject, Moses and Aaron Collecting Alms for the Building of the Temple, reflects the function of the room. In this lunette Gargiulo already presents the compositional and stylistic features that would characterize his paintings in the lay brothers' choir in the Certosa	GARGIULO, Domenico	Moses and Aaron Collecting Alms for the Building of the Temple	Fresco	1640	religious	Italian	1601-1650
11285-307delac.jpg	The capture of Algiers in 1830 had given France the Sultan of Morocco as a neighbour. Louis Philippe's government decided to send him an ambassador extraordinary, the Comte de Mornay; the latter wished to take an official artist with him and chose Eugene Delacroix. The mission left Toulon on 11 January 1832, landed at Tangiers on the 25 January, travelled through a part of Morocco, and returned via Oran and Algiers.During his visit to this country, Delacroix witnessed spectacles belonging to a noble and primitive way of life which provided material for his art until he died; but he had not been allowed to enter the jealously guarded harems of the Moslems. It was the chief harbour engineer at Algiers who persuaded one of the port officials, a former reis or owner of privateers, to allow Delacroix into his own harem.In these few hours Delacroix did several watercolour sketches, some of which are in the Louvre. Using them as a basis, he painted a large picture on his return, and exhibited it in the 1834 salon. He wanted to show the dark tones of flesh and the subdued colours in the warm half-light of the harem.In 1849 he painted another smaller version of the same subject, now in the Musée de Montpellier. Here the colours are softer and the atmosphere more intimate; it has a note of nostalgia absent from the 1834 Salon picture, which is still full of his first impressions, and which already foreshadows Renoir. The latter artist was well aware of this relationship; in 1872 he painted a large picture inspired by Delacroix's canvas and called Les Parisiennes habillées en Algériennes (Tokyo Museum). He had already done an Odalisque and exhibited it in the 1870 Salon. (Chester Dale Collection, New York.)

The figures, delineated with just a few bare contours and dark areas of colour, bear witness to the calm and economy of motion that attracted Rippl-Rónai to the game.

07580-49franci.jpg	The founder of the Franciscan Order was the first person to experience the miracle of stigmatization of his own body. In other words, he was marked out by Christ's wounds. Here he is reduced to the ideal state of penance in the wilderness - a state equally valid for saints and pious people. Caravaggio shows no sign of reinterpreting the story unconventionally. His rather traditional approach may derive from the fact that the composition is probably a commission from the papal family. They owned the township known as Carpineto, from where an almost identical second version, stored at present in the Palazzo Venezia, Rome, originated. Stylistically, the painting is very closely related to the Brera Supper in Emmaus, which was probably painted in Latium.

33006-07farnes.jpg	The conclusion of the Psyche story takes place in two broad format paintings in the vault panel. Raphael places these scenes in an illusionistic tapestry that appears to be hung between the garlands. Thus the artist avoids the extreme foreshortening that would have been required of an illusionistic prospect of the sky in this same place. On the right Raphael depicts the council of the gods in which Jupiter decides to accept Psyche and mercury gives her the drink of immortality. Then the wedding is celebrated in the painting on the left.

27193-levantin.jpg	Hendrik van Minderhout painted a number of large exotic harbour scenes such as this which follow in the tradition of Jan Baptist Weenix and Johannes Lingelbach. He favoured compositions built around a central quay lavishly staffed, with Dutch vessels in the open water to the left and Roman ruins or a steep hill to the right to create a high repoussoir and offset his scenes against a richly coloured early evening sky.The present painting shows a Levantine harbour with a galley and a man-of-war coming in to anchor, together with many figures on shore	MINDERHOUT, Hendrik van	A Levantine Harbour	Oil on canvas, 163 x 243	1681	landscape	Flemish	1651-1700

00029-philocte.jpg	From 1772 Abildgaard spent five years in Rome thanks to a scholarship granted by the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen. It was while in Rome that he created this depiction of the legendary hero Philoctetes, whose screams of pain caused by a festering snakebite made his comrades-in-arms abandon him on a Greek island during the Trojan war.Abildgaard used a principal work of classical sculpture as the basis for his rendition of Philoctetes' tormented state: the Torso Belvedere in the Vatican museum served as the model for the plastic and mannered rendition of the hero's upper body. With this move, Abildgaard's stylistic innovation was imbued with features of a work canonised by neoclassicism - without, however, reducing the tensions in the painting	ABILDGAARD, Nicolai	The Wounded Philoctetes	Oil on canvas, 123 x 178 cm	1775	mythological	Danish	1751-1800

35911-barberin.jpg	The picture shows the painting on the ceiling vault of the hall in the apartment of Anna Colonna in the north wing of the Palazzo Barberini. It represents the Triumph of Divina Sapientia.The Palazzo Barberini, residence of the papal family Barberini, set a new standard for Roman palace architecture and its painted decoration. Planning for the expansion of the sixteenth-century structure was first undertaken by Carlo Maderno, then transferred after his death to Gian Lorenzo Bernini, who here distinguished himself as an architect for the first time.The first commission for the painted decor was given to Andrea Sacchi who in 1629-30 painted the ceiling of the largest room in the wing occupied by Anna Colonna, Taddeo Barberini's wife. Sacchi painted here the fresco identified as Triumph of Divina Sapientia (divine wisdom). Sirens in the room corners hold up small sun disks that extend up into the fresco. They anticipate the theme of the ceiling, in which the sun plays a central role.The design of the ceiling omits architectural elements completely. Viewers find themselves confronted with a startling heavenly vision including, among other things, realistically depicted astronomical bodies - Earth and the sun hand directly above them. The personification of Divine Wisdom is seated on the Solomonic lion throne, crowned by two Barberini bees, before a huge radiating solar disk in yellow-gold. Imaginative cloud formations fill the greater part of the picture surface, creating a perspective pull that graphically suggests the vast distance between the smaller Earth at the bottom edge of the picture and the gigantic sun.It is obvious that Sacchi's ceiling presents a commentary on the then current issue of Galileo Galilei's heliocentric worldview	SACCHI, Andrea	Ceiling fresco	Fresco	1629-30	mythological	Italian	1601-1650

42967-01view.jpg	In 1577 a serious fire in the Palazzo Ducale destroyed the Sala del Maggior Consiglio, originally the meeting place for the Venetian legislature. It necessitated the wholesale renovation of the pictorial decoration, and artists received explicit instructions about subject and even composition, the idea being to emulate the visual authority of the destroyed works as closely as possible.In the redecorated room the thirty-five ceiling canvases, some of them by Veronese, celebrate the glory of Venice allegorically and illustrate the Republic's military history. On the end wall Tintoretto and his pupils painted the enormous representation of Paradise.

23737-gypsy.jpg	Vladimir Yegorovich Makovsky's subject bears heavily on a traditional Russian subject. Gypsy Girl defies the tradition of Romanticism and neo-Classicism, which dominated Russian art in the first half of the nineteenth century. As a founding member of Peredvizhniki, or &#145;The Wanderers', a group of artists who aimed to bring art into life, like their contemporaries in literature and in music, such as Feodor Dostoyevsky and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakoff, respectively, Makovsky's painting is a strong response to Russia's traditional Slavic heritage.

Meanwhile, however, Mary and Joseph had fled to safety with their baby. The senseless slaughter of the innocents is an example of ruthless tyranny.

44047-2abegg.jpg	The Abegg Triptych was painted for an Italian gentleman, an unidentified member of the Villa family from Chieri in Piedmont, who were active in banking in the Netherlands. Their coat of arms appears in the glazed window in the left wing. The picture is generally regarded as a late work by one of Rogier's successors, perhaps not painted until the 1460s, though some of the figures of the Crucifixion were copied as early as 1447 by the Hamburg painter Hans Bornemann, who died in 1475. The costume of the donor and the findings from dendrochronological investigation allow us to date the picture to the middle of the 1440s. Compared to figures in works by Rogier's own hand the figures here, particularly in the Crucifixion, seem excessively emotional; instead of radiating dignified grief they are uttering loud cries of lamentation.Once again, the design of the triptych must have been by an assistant in Rogier's workshop. The figure of the red-robed St. John to the left of the Cross shows how he reworked the master's figural types to suit his own ideas. The model is St John in Rogier's Deposition (Prado, Madrid), and it is followed faithfully in such details as the right foot. The folds of the robe, however, are more strongly modeled.The cloak in particular, very dynamically draped and with a large fold flung backward over the shoulder, gives the figure a sense of agitation that is in tune with the character of this painting as a whole, but not with its model. Similarly, Mary Magdalene's cloak slipping down from her hips picks up a motif from the Deposition, but combines it with an extrovert gesture foreign to that picture, with the saint suddenly flinging up her arms.The series of the three panels follows a chronological sequence: the sculptural Annunciation group in the donor's loggia refers to Christ's becoming man; in the central panel Christ has just died, and the sun and moon turn dark as His companions break into loud lamentations; on the right Joseph of Arimathaea, Nicodemus, and a servant are approaching with a ladder to take the dead body down from the Cross	WEYDEN, Rogier van der	Abegg Triptych	Oil on oak panel, 102 x 70,5 cm (central), 103 x 31 cm (each wing)	c. 1445	religious	Flemish	1401-1450

23820-7marine1.jpg	"In the fertile years that followed his Déjeuner and Olympia, Manet experimented very widely. Sometimes he focused on giving form to colour and movement in works like the Bullfight, at others he was inspired by contemporary events, such as the Battle of the ""Kearsarge"" and the ""Alabama"" off Cherbourg. This episode of the American War of Independence made a considerable impression on public opinion. The work testified to Manet's modernity, but was also an attempt to renew the theme of naval combat traditional in Dutch painting. It is, in fact, a battle between colour and light, where the blacks and the few dots of red enhance the tumultuous green of the waves"	MANET, Edouard	"The Battle of the ""Kearsarge"" and the ""Alabama"""	Oil on canvas, 134 x 127 cm	1864	landscape	French	1851-1900

34223-st_paul.jpg	The seventeenth century was a very productive period for Spanish painting. Spain's extensive trade links brought with them an interchange of artistic ideas, particularly with Italy. Jusepe de Ribera played an important role in this. He began his studies with Ribalta but left Spain early on and went to Italy, where he discovered the work of Caravaggio. His style is characterized by strong light and shade, together with a realistic portrayal even of religious themes, as seen in his St Paul the Hermit of 1647	RIBERA, Jusepe de	St Paul the Hermit	Oil on canvas, 130 x 104 cm	1647	religious	Spanish	1601-1650

16929-death_v0.jpg	The major painting of Van der Goes's third period (between around 1478 and 1482) and very likely one of the last works he painted is the Death of the Virgin. The panel is almost square in shape. The scene is set in a totally enclosed room. The apostles are grouped around Mary's bed. The Virgin's fine blue robe contrast with the purple sheets that cover the bed. Her livid gray face is framed by the immaculate whiteness of her wimple, and of the cushion on which her head rests. Her hands are joined, her fingers look quite bony. Her eyes have lost their lustre. She looks up one last time towards the heavens, where her Son appears to her in His glory with arms outstretched, to display the wounds in his hands. He is dressed in a blue robe and a large red cloak held up by two angels. The picture represents the moment at which life has already gently slipped away, but death has not yet completed its work.The painter uses the apostles to ring the changes on the different varieties of grief, and their profound sadness contrasts with the detachment of the Virgin herself. Their clothes have been creased into countless shifting folds which cut across one another at right angles. Van der Goes is revealed as a penetrating analyst of religious feeling, of grief and devotion, and of the agitation they can cause. This work, like all those he painted during his last period, represents the eruption of sacred experience into a profane world. The artist achieves this through an abundant use of colours which strike the viewer as unreal, as if they were themselves transfigured. In this way, Van der Goes seeks to identify his painting with the mystery of transcendence itself.To this end too, the gestures of his figures are emphatic. He uses techniques or the progressive reduction of pictorial space and the transformation of figures, which he paints half-length, not full length	GOES, Hugo van der	The Death of the Virgin	Oil on wood, 147,8 x 122,5 cm	c. 1480	religious	Flemish	1451-1500

04806-cremona4.jpg	The decoration of the Cremona Cathedral was begun in the semi-dome vault of the apse in 1506. Boccaccio Boccaccino depicted, following a time-honoured scheme, the Epiphany of God in the Last Days (Christ in Majesty) as the principal and culminating image within the church space. Later, in 1514 Boccaccino received the commission to begin a fresco cycle of the life of Mary and Christ on the walls of the nave. They begin on the left wall, running from the façade to the apse and then on the right wall from the apse back to the façade. The left wall is dedicated to Mary and Christ's childhood; the right to the Passion.Boccaccino divided the rectangular sections above the arcades of the nave into two fields by painted pilasters. The scenes of the fresco cycle were placed into these sections. In 1514-15 Boccaccino began with the first four scenes of the story of Mary above the first and second arches of the arcade: Annunciation to Joachim; Meeting at the Golden Gate; Birth of Mary; Betrothal of Mary. Boccaccino painted the next four scenes of the cycle in 1515-17 above the third and fourth arches: Annunciation to Mary; Visitation; Adoration of the Shepherds; Circumcision of Christ.In designing the cycle Boccaccino followed a famous model, Albrecht Dürer's woodcut series Life of the Virgin. Boccaccino did not copy Dürer's inventions, but found inspiration in just a few crucial constellations of figures. For the individual motifs, the formal language of the details, and the shaping of the whole, Boccaccino followed Italian traditions.In the Meeting at the Golden Gate, the tender embrace of Joachim and Anna is united by the arch of the gate over their heads.

The tower has been hit by lightning around ten times, and the whole church has burned down three times throughout its known existence.The picture, which positions the viewer in a hamlet just outside the city gates, is dotted with figures illustrative of village life, and overshadowed by the imposing silhouette of St. Olav's which dominates the town around it.

Saenredam made several drawings and paintings of the church shortly after construction was completed.

03068-hersemer.jpg	Ovid (Met. 2:708-832) tells how three sisters, returning from the festival of Minerva and carrying her sacred baskets on their heads, were espied by Mercury who immediately fell in love with the most beautiful of them, Herse. Another of the sisters, Aglauros, was consumed with envy, and tried to prevent Mercury entering Herse's chamber when he came to her one night. He touched Aglauros with his wand and she turned to black stone, the colour of her thoughts.The present playful and sensuous representation of the story is similar both in style and theme to a number of others executed by van Balen and his circle. Van Balen was specialised in small cabinet pictures which often depicted mythological scenes.

01109-salvator.jpg	This superb panel painting has been mistreated over the centuries, and to complicate matters, the artist himself had adjusted his original ideas, including a change in the placement of Christ's right hand. The insistent frontality of the figure recalls Byzantine images.

13020-porziaim.jpg	During his trip to Italy and in particular when he was living in Genoa, Anthony van Dyck painted many portraits of members of patrician families. These were strongly influenced by those that Peter Paul Rubens had produced for the same families almost two decades earlier. From these Van Dyck borrowed the structures and the chromatic oppositions between the dark, court clothing and the bright ruffs, embroideries and jewels. The painting in the Brussels museum is a good example of this type of official representation.Porzia Imperiale and her daughter Maria Francesca belonged to a family of Genoese bankers. On 5 August 1610 the mother married Bartolomeo Imperiale, probably a distant cousin. Born in around 1586, she must have been between 35 and 40 when Anthony van Dyck stayed in Genoa. Maria Francesca's date of birth is not known, but the inscription Virtute gaudet (she rejoices in virtue) on the virginal, exalting the young girl's honour, shows that she was of marriageable age. Women occupied a special place in the Republic of Genoa. It is therefore not surprising to see them associated with Virtue, a quality with heroic connotations that is more generally ascribed to men.Porzia Imperiale, seated here, is dressed in a black gown, its severity softened by an imposing ruff, a double chain, engraved buttons and lace-edged cuffs. In her left hand she carries a closed fan, whilst her right hand rests on the arm of the chair. Her daughter wears a light-coloured gown with silvery reflections, decorated with gilded braid and a ruff, its moiré reflections very finely balancing the dark mass of her mother's gown. Porzia Imperiale's determined face contrasts with Maria Francesca's gentle and innocent looks. The background architectural details and the heavy red drapery confer a monumental aspect to the painting, further accentuated by the way in which the figures literally dominate the spectator, who views them from a low-angle position. The subtlety with which Van Dyck renders the different dark nuances is proof of an uncommon skill	DYCK, Sir Anthony van	Portrait of Porzia Imperiale and Her Daughter	Oil on canvas, 184,5 x 134 cm	c. 1628	portrait	Flemish	1601-1650
10011-herdemo1.jpg	This painting and its companion piece, Cheerful Democritus, depict two men with diametrically opposed views of the world. The subjects of the paintings are the Greek philosophers Democritus of Abdera and Heraclitus of Ephesus.  Their views of life could not have been more different:  Democritus never stopped laughing at the follies of humankind while Heraclitus wept continuously over the condition of the world. There are numerous representations of them in Greek and Roman art and literature, but the theme fell out of favour in post-classical art and was not revived until the late 15th century. By about 1600 Democritus and Heraclitus once again became a popular subject, particularly in the Netherlands, and the philosophers are depicted either in pairs or a single composition.

32444-concert2.jpg	Mattia Preti's Concert is a work which has a bearing on the artistic links between Italy and the Netherlands. Its style is strongly influenced by Caravaggio, particularly in its formal aspects: the strong chiaroscuro reaches an extreme degree in the faces of the three figures. At the same time, the painting also demonstrates the interest in depicting everyday life so characteristic of the art of northern Europe, and takes pleasure in painting the details of the clothing and objects.The composition of the scene and the descending ray of light that isolates the three youths in the darkness reflect the influence of the tavern and gambling scenes painted by Bartolomeo Manfredi and Valentin de Boulogne and other early followers of Caravaggio	PRETI, Mattia	The Concert	Oil on canvas, 107 x 145 cm	c. 1635	genre	Italian	1651-1700

08976-vanitas2.jpg	This painting represents a vanitas still-life with a book, a glass roemer, a skull, a lute, a pack of cards and piece of parchment on a table. This is probably the last known vanitas still-life executed by the artist. Although Claesz. started painting vanitas still-lifes in the 1620s the majority of his works in this genre were executed in the 1650s. During the last decade of his life he favoured grander, more detailed compositions in contrast to his earlier sober style	CLAESZ., Pieter	Vanitas Still-Life	Oil on canvas, 50 x 65 cm	1659-60	still-life	Dutch	1601-1650
16731-sleeping.jpg	This painting was for a long time considered to be the work of Girolamo Savoldo. However, the attribution to Girolamo Treviso is now unanimously accepted.

39134-02zianig.jpg	Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo decorated with frescoes the family villa at Zianigo which his father, Giovanni Baptista Tiepolo had bought on his return from the task of decorating the Prince-Bishop's palace in Würzburg and which he had restored and altered to his own needs. The frescoes were painted over a fairly long period of time: between 1759 - the date shown on one of the monochrome scenes from the chapel - and 1797 - according to a now lost inscription read at the beginning of the twentieth century in a mural scene in the Pulcinella Room. Almost all the frescoes in the small Zianigo villa were detached in 1906 and in 1936 they were moved to the Ca' Rezzonico and placed in small rooms, in a recomposition that closely repeats the original one, though with some differences and overlapping.The frescoes in the villa depict the stories of Pulcinella (also Punchinello, a classical character that originated in the Commedia dell'arte of the 17th century), scenes of villa life, games, the wars and affections of satyrs and fauns. It is a comprehensive cycle which Giovanni Domenico painted for himself in successive stages in the non-monumental rooms of the country house. When completed, the whole Zianigo work was a kind of grand recapitulation of many aspects and idiosyncrasies of Giovanni Domenico's art, while also representing the cultural passing of a period and a style. It is almost a pictorial testament which, while valuing the past, did not conceal the drama of the present nor the uncertainty of the future	TIEPOLO, Giovanni Domenico	View of the Pulcinella Room	Fresco	1759-97	interior	Italian	1751-1800
26068-18portra.jpg	The tightly framed composition of this portrait makes it one of the most compact images ever painted by Memling. The solid head occupies virtually the entire width of the painting, with more than half of the shoulders and hands cut off the edge. The sensation of extreme proximity is exceptionally strong. The viewpoint is so low that the flat landscape, with a little church in the distance, can barely be discerned above the subject's shoulders, while his head stands out monumentally against the sky. The broadly drawn, wispy clouds appear to be a later addition. The man wears a dark jacket lined with white fur, flecked with brown, and an asymmetrical collar over a red waistcoat. The wider right lapel is folded over, and if fastened would reach high above its counterpart. A small crucifix set with pearls hangs from a golden chain, half beneath and half on top of the collar. The young man in London's National Gallery has a similar piece of jewellery, which he wears in the same way. It must have been a common ornament, because a version of it also appears in the Bruges Portrait of a young woman and in the allegorical figure of a girl in New York. The man's devotion is evidently directed towards a lost representation, probably of the Virgin and Child.When closed, this diptych would have displayed the coat-of-arms that is still to be found on the reverse. The man probably belonged to the Lespinette family (Franche-Comté). Since its auction (as a work by Antonello da Messina) in 1894, the painting has been accepted as a Memling. It is generally compared with his portraits from the 1480s, and shows a particular similarity in its modelling to the Bruges Portrait of a young woman of 1480.It is understandable that some people should have been inclined to attribute this admirable portrait to Antonello, such is its precision and assurance of drawing and modelling of the face; but in the features, which are as though engraved, and the pointed steeple visible in the background, give a Flemish character of this picture	MEMLING, Hans	Portrait of a Man at Prayer before a Landscape	Oil on oak panel, 30 x 22 cm	c. 1480	portrait	Flemish	1451-1500
10989-213david.jpg	If little else were known of David, the self-portrait that he painted in May 1791 certainly looks the image of a Romantic. Painted rapidly, with a spontaneous touch, it shows an excited, even wild young man, with freely curling hair, eyes aglow with almost visionary zeal. He is looking slightly dishevelled and with a piercing gaze, very different from the normally relaxed pose of his sitters and perhaps an indication of the internal conflicts that eventually led him to become a fully committed Republican	DAVID, Jacques-Louis	Self-Portrait	Oil on canvas, 64 x 53 cm	1791	portrait	French	1801-1850
07498-22barber.jpg	The still undeveloped features of this young cleric, who later became Pope Urban VIII (1623-1644) were portrayed as a much more distinguished figure by the skills of Gianlorenzo Bernini (1598-1680). Here, the face appears in chiaroscuro against a neutral background in such a way that a wall appears to be screening off the figure from the left. In order to give the figure more 'rilievo', or more three-dimensionality, the lit sections are painted against a dark, and the sections in shadow against a light, background	CARAVAGGIO	Portrait of Maffeo Barberini	Oil on canvas, 124 x 90 cm	1599	portrait	Italian	1551-1600

42079-jacob.jpg	In this painting Varotari depicts a scene from the biblical story of Jacob. It shows Jacob telling Rachel and Leah that he wishes to leave Laban's service. Jacob urges Rachel and Leah to leave with him.According to the Bible, Leah becomes Jacob's wife through a deception on the part of her father, Laban. In the Biblical account, Jacob is dispatched to the hometown of Laban - the brother of his mother Rebekah - to avoid being killed by his brother Esau, and to find a wife. Out by the well, he encounters Laban's younger daughter Rachel tending her father's sheep, and decides to marry her. Laban is willing to give Rachel's hand to Jacob as long as he works seven years for her. On the wedding night, however, Laban switches Leah for Rachel. Later Laban claims that it is uncustomary to give the younger daughter away in marriage before the older one. Laban offers to give Rachel to Jacob in marriage in return for another seven years of work. Jacob accepts the offer and marries Rachel after the week-long celebration of his marriage to Leah	VAROTARI, Dario the Elder	Scene from the Story of Jacob	Oil on canvas, 63 x 138 cm	-	religious	Italian	1551-1600
13660-adorati.jpg	The Adoration of the Magi, is one of the fourteen panels from the altarpiece of the Chancel in Viseu Cathedral, and the earliest dated work of the artist. It  is a key work in the evaluation of the impact which the painting and the painters from southern parts of the Low Countries had on the taste of patrons and on the work of painters in Portugal. Despite the controversy surrounding its authorship, everything points to a team, led by the Flemish painter Francisco Henriques, joined locally by the young Vasco Fernandes, elaborating the altarpiece for the bishop of Viseu.The Adoration of the Magi includes iconographic details which confirm that the altarpiece was made locally.  The black Wise King, Balthasar, is replaced by an Indian from Brazil. The closeness in time of this artistic representation (the first in Western art) to the discovery of the lands of the True Cross (Brazil) gives it an extraordinary historical value	FERNANDES, Vasco	Adoration of the Magi	Oil on wood, 132 x 79 cm	1501-06	religious	Portuguese	1501-1550
26601-2ceil_ve.jpg	"In planning the architectural design Michelangelo first had to accommodate his program to the pre-existing building, including the windows, which were the source of light for his decoration. The wreath of openings still provides the principal viewing light.Michelangelo devised a long central area framed by a fictive marble cornice and separated into nine sections by broad pilaster strips bent across the ceiling, also in imitation white marble. Sections of alternating dimensions are framed between wider and narrower bands. Within them Michelangelo varied the size of the actual narratives, giving only the smaller ones a marble frame. Four ignudi (male nudes), among the most admired elements of the ceiling, ostensibly support ribbons attached to large medallions painted to look like bronze. Twenty in all, they are in different poses, producing, together with the Prophets and Sibyls, a ""handbook"" of alternatives for the seated figure for later artists.At the corners of the ceiling Michelangelo has painted four salvation subjects, including David and Goliath and Judith and Holofernes. Triangular-shaped compartments are repeated in a continuous band along the entire border of the ceiling; they contain bronze-colored nudes that alternate with the renowned Prophets and Sibyls set into marble thrones which, in turn, have paired marble putti in a variety of poses and positions that expand upon the tradition of Donatello and Luca della Robbia. The ancestors of Christ are painted on the flat side walls, the only section of the decoration that did not require the visual adjustments posed by painting on a curved surface"	MICHELANGELO Buonarroti	The ceiling	Fresco	1508-12	religious	Italian	1501-1550
26107-29jerome.jpg	This small panel was only discovered relatively recently (1945) and so does not feature in most of the Memling literature. Nevertheless, it is an interesting little work which corresponds fully with Memling's style and spatial approach. The composition derives from Rogier van der Weyden. It portrays the episode in which Jerome removes the thorn from the lion's paw. The architectural setting is a characteristic Memling invention. The scene is viewed through a heavy round arch in brown stone, positioned at an angle close to the picture plane. It is related to the more modest little arches in the wings containing the Allegory of True Love. The fairly heavily dotted little trees in the background also recall that work.The odd way the image is cropped to the left and right is not the result of its having been narrowed at some stage, but is in fact deliberate. The angled position of the arch might indicate that this was once a left wing. The panel has been cut off at the top and bottom. Considering the size of the figure and the wooded landscape, it could be a side panel for the St Jerome in Basel	MEMLING, Hans	St Jerome and the Lion	Oil on oak panel, 37 x 24,5 cm	1485-90	religious	Flemish	1451-1500

11942-zenobi02.jpg	The core element around which the rooms of the Zenobio palace are organized is the large double-story main hall (ballroom) complete with an orchestra balcony, and embellished with complex stucco work created by Abbondio Stazio sometime later than the frescoes. Twelve personifications of the Arts and Sciences, among them the nine Muses, sit on imaginary stools along the cornice that circles the walls of the room. The ceiling opens wide, exploding into an ornate projecting cornice that rests on large, bulging corbels. The large elliptical opening frames a view of the sky containing an allegorical depiction of Aurora. The entire ceiling is punctuated by displays of flowers and fruit.

03044-09mucius.jpg	Mucius Scaevola (Livy 2:12-13) was a hero of Roman legend. When the Etruscan forces, led by Lars Porsena, king of Clusium, were besieging Rome, a young Roman nobleman, Caius Mucius, succeeded in penetrating the enemy lines in disguise, meaning to kill Porsena. By mistake he killed the king's secretary who was sitting beside him. Mucius was seized but, to show how cheaply he held his life, thrust his right hand into the flames of an altar fire and let it burn. Porsena, amazed by his endurance, set him free. He was thereafter called Scaevola, meaning 'left-handed'.In painting, of the Renaissance and later, Mucius stands for the virtues of patience and constancy. His sacrifice was also held to be a prefiguration of Christ's sacrifice	BALDUNG GRIEN, Hans	Mucius Scaevola	Lime wood, 98 x 68 cm	1531	historical	German	1501-1550

43479-mancini4.jpg	Ortensia Mancini (1646-1699), was the fourth of the five celebrated Mancini Sisters (Laure, Olympe, Marie, Marie Anne and Ortensia), daughters of the sister of Cardinal Mazarin, the chief advisor of the young King Louis XIV of France and reputed lover of his mother, Anne of Austria. After their father's death in 1650, the Mancini girls were brought to France by their mother, who hoped that her brother would help find rich and titled husbands for her brood of girls.The five Mancini girls were to become the talk of Paris thanks to their sumptuous dark haired, olive skinned beauty and wild, flamboyant manners, with the young Ortensia (Hortense in Paris), her uncle's favourite niece being the most badly behaved of them all as she grew up into a bold eyed beauty, who was absolutely impossible to resist.At the age of fifteen Hortense was married to one of the richest men in all Europe, the Duc de Meilleraye, with the couple being declared Duc and Duchesse de Mazarin after their wedding day	VOET, Jacob Ferdinand	Portrait of Ortensia Mancini	Oil on canvas, 73 x 57 cm	-	portrait	Flemish	1651-1700

27061-maurits1.jpg	In 1607 the Delft city fathers commissioned the Delft portraitist Michiel van Miereveld to paint a portrait of the Dutch stadholder Prince Maurits (1567-1625). Van Miereveld went to The Hague to record his subjects's features and produced this portrait of the prince in armour, with sword and baton, representing his role as captain general of the Dutch army. This picture became the model for all the later portraits of the prince. (A full-length version of this portrait from 1615-20 is now in the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam.) The portrait was engraved by Jan Muller in 1608and, like countless copies from Van Mireveld's workshop, hung in homes throughout the Netherlands. A bust-length version of the 1607 composition hangs above the fireplace in A Man Weighing Gold by Cornelis de Man	MIEREVELD, Michiel Jansz. van	Portrait of Maurits, Prince of Orange-Nassau	Oil on panel, 110 x 98 cm	1607	portrait	Dutch	1601-1650

16472-4crucif2.jpg	The crucifix was first attributed to Giotto by Lorenzo Ghiberti, who in his Commentaries quoted other works of the master in the altars of the church of Ognissanti, like the Virgin of Ognissanti and the Dormitio Virginis. Originally it was probably located on the presbytery, dominating the nave and the faithful, near the Virgin of Ognissanti.In poor condition, it was kept in a room adjacent to the basilica and attributed to an artist close to Giotto and possessing great pictorial capacities.The work was restored from 2005 onwards by Opificio delle pietre dura from Florence and was attributed to Giotto himself, for a date which is around 1315. On November 6, 2010, the crucifix was reinstalled inside the left transept, enhanced by proper illumination.Intended for the procession, it is in conformity with the monumental representations of Christ in the cross of the time, namely: the Christ on the cross is in the suffering position; the body falling; the belly prominent on its perizonium; the head leaning forward touching the shoulder; the prominent ribs; the bloody wounds; the superimposed feet.The crucifix has small panels with scenes on the ends of the cross: the Virgin Mary on the left clothed in blue, St John on the right, hands clasped, and on top the titulus in red is surmounted by a blessing Christ accompanied by the Book. The background contains patterned gold behind the body of Christ.The cleaning and retouching of the blackened cross has revealed individual brush strokes and the bright colour of the lapis lazuli used by the artist. This expensive pigment now dominates the background of the work. Infrared photography and X-rays studies unearthed clear proof of the authorship of Giotto	GIOTTO di Bondone	Crucifix	Tempera and gold on fir panel, 468 x 375 cm	1300-15	religious	Italian	1301-1350

24779-portrait.jpg	The sitter probably was Robert de Masmines, a distinguished Burgundian soldier, identifiable on the basis of a drawing now in Arras.

34210-diogenes.jpg	The most famous of the Cynics, the philosopher Diogenes of Sinope, who died in 323 BC, is provided here with a lamp by way of an attribute. According to his own statement, he used it in broad daylight to find a 'genuine person' on a bustling marketplace. The subject was much loved throughout Baroque Europe, although it appears that the Italians preferred to depict the philosopher alone, as with this and another painting by Ribera, while the densely populated scenes were more popular in the Netherlands.Ribera was interested in studying different types of people, and even his religious paintings seem to be populated with figures taken from the everyday world about him, in the tradition of Caravaggio. The subject of this portrait must have prompted this depiction of an eccentric outsider, his hair tangled, his beard unkempt, his hands work-worn, dressed in simple apparel, and directing a penetrating gaze at the beholder	RIBERA, Jusepe de	Diogenes	Oil on canvas, 76 x 61 cm	1637	historical	Spanish	1601-1650
14480-410fried.jpg	This painting, depicting an area of pastureland crossed by tree-lined avenues just outside Dresden, portrayed in masterly fashion from an alienating angle, is an example of Friedrich's final phase of full mastery. He uses an exquisite palette to evoke a particularly solemn evening mood and thereby lends a rhythmic impulse to the foreground with rivulets of water glinting in the sunset. With the richness of its palette, the beauty of its composition and its sonorous atmosphere, this impressive painting is a true masterpiece in the history of European landscape painting	FRIEDRICH, Caspar David	The Grosse Gehege near Dresden	Oil on canvas, 73,5 x 102,5 cm	c. 1832	landscape	German	1801-1850
05786-portrait.jpg	"In Rome the young Bourdon was exposed to some of the greatest portraits of the Renaissance in the collections there, as well as to the constant experiments of artists as diverse as Bernini, Lanfranco and Domenichino, who all painted portraits. from all these influences Bourdon compounded his own style, which inevitably became a formula, but a successful one. He often painted his sitters three-quarters on, in a soft and even light, and preferred waist-length portraits and a feeling of relative informality. With his curious mixture of Italian influences, Bourdon set the style for middle-class French portraiture for almost the rest of the century. One of the best examples is his Portrait of a Man at Montpellier, which is a ""tour de force"" of subtle modelling and lighting. Indeed, almost all the surviving middle-class portraits of the time in France, that are not by Philippe de Champaigne and his followers, copy this type.The sitter of this portrait is unknown"	BOURDON, Sébastien	Portrait of a Man	Oil on canvas, 105 x 65 cm	-	portrait	French	1601-1650
23120-12enthro.jpg	This altarpiece was painted for the church of San Francesco in Pistoia, where remained until 1799, to be transferred in the Uffizi Gallery. Among the latest work of Pietro Lorenzetti, the picture shows the tender motif of the silent colloquy that binds Mother and Child, which is characteristic of the style of other contemporary masters, as Giotto or the sculptor Giovanni Pisano. The predella paintings, described by Vasari, are lost.The painting was restored several times since the 18th century, originally it was higher.

42849-12deadch.jpg	Veronese's images of the Lamentation (he painted several versions of this subject) often convey a haunting reminder of a happy world, thereby increasing the pathos of the Passion. In this painting the heightened sensibility is achieved by the shocking contrast between flashes of elegant drapery (the angels' suavely tinted attire) and Christ still-beautiful, abused flesh. Such calculated inconsistency can make suffering far more moving than a more predictable, uniform pall	VERONESE, Paolo	Dead Christ Supported by Two Angels	Oil on canvas, 110 94 cm	1587-89	religious	Italian	1551-1600
38897-stair1.jpg	On the ceiling of the staircase the image of Time Revealing Truth and Casting Out Envy is depicted.

12060-young_gi.jpg	This panel depicts a young girl at a window ledge with a cat and a mouse-trap, a hung duck and a pewter ewer beside her.Dou's genre paintings are often imbued with subtle emblematic meanings which would certainly not have been lost on his public. In 17th-century paintings, and in particular in Dou's own work, certain everyday objects took on other meanings and were therefore chosen by the artist for a specific reason: a set of scales, for example, could allude to the virtues of moderation and temperance; an empty bird-cage was a conventional symbol of immorality; and the open mouse-trap and lascivious expression of the cat in this painting could equally have carried some erotic overtones	DOU, Gerrit	Young Girl at a Window Ledge	Oil on panel, 33 x 25 cm	c. 1672	portrait	Dutch	1651-1700
29136-portr_ab.jpg	Numerous portraits have been attributed to Jan Mostaert. These range from those of ancient nobility to lesser Dutch aristocrats and burghers. The royal portraits are all copies after originals painted for Margaret of Austria, but the others are taken from life and then imbued with an aristocratic flavour through the settings. Such is the case in the present portrait where a coat of arms in the architecture and the initials on the cushion beneath his hands identify the sitter, who was a knight of a well-known Haarlem family	MOSTAERT, Jan	Portrait of Abel van den Colster	Panel, 90 x 56 cm	1500-10	portrait	Dutch	1501-1550

09665-1stufa3.jpg	"The picture shows one of the scenes in the Stanza della Stufa. A Roman general distributes the spoils of war to his soldiers, who have proven their valour in combat. In the foreground, a group of prisoners in chains is huddled next to a bundle of trophies. According to Ovid, people in the Age of Bronze may have been wild and combative, but they were neither cruel nor immoral.The Stanza della Stufa is a smaller room on the piano nobile that was one of the grand duke's private chambers. It took its name from its heated floor (""stufa"" means heater). Cortona painted here the Age of Gold and the Age of Silver on the north wall in 1637. The Age of Bronze and Age of Iron were realized only later in 1641.

10289-03young3.jpg	The painting has a companion piece depicting the Portrait of a Clean-Shaven Young Man. Both half-length figures are placed close to the picture surface against a bright green background. The close attachment of the two people is suggested in their dress: they wear similar caps, his adorned with stitching, hers with a round agrafe. The freshness  of the observation and the finesse of its realisation recall Netherlandish portraits of the period, such as those of Joos van Cleve and Quentin Massys, for example	CRANACH, Lucas the Elder	Portrait of a Young Woman	Oil and tempera on red beechwood, 59 x 41 cm	1522	portrait	German	1501-1550

20475-sacrific.jpg	A particularly accomplished draughtsman, Empoli (actually Jacopo Chimenti) presents us here with an austere composition, one which succeeds in avoiding the least hint of sentimentalism, yet is nonetheless psychologically charged.

03532-prodigal.jpg	In his small painting depicting the biblical tale about the prodigal son Baumgartner not only used the rocaille as a frame, but as a motif in itself.

35682-benthei.jpg	During the years from about 1650 to about 1655, the heroic quality of Ruisdael's landscapes increases. The forms become larger and more massive. Giant oaks and beeches as well as shrubs acquire an unprecedented abundance and fullness. Colours become more vivid, space increases in both height and depth, and there is an emphasis on the tectonic structure of the compositions. He strove to achieve heroic effects without sacrificing the individuality of a single tree or bush. An outstanding example of this tendency is his mighty view of Bentheim Castle.Ruisdael visited Bentheim, a small town in Wesphalia near the Dutch-German border, when he travelled to the region with his friend Berchem in the early fifties. Bentheim's castle is, in fact, on an unimposing low hill, but in his painting Ruisdael enlarged it into a wooded mountain providing the castle with a commanding position. His invention is a superb expression of his aggrandizement of solid forms during this phase. The dense mass of the mountain, obliquely stretching away into depth, and the coulisses on either side of the front edge of the painting are reminiscent of compositional schemes used by the generation of his teachers, but the spatial clarity is new, as are the strong colours, the energy of the brushwork, and the way he unifies the close view of a nearly overwhelming wealth of detail with the most distant parts of the landscape into a consistent whole. The impact of the broad prospect is as intense as the vegetation seen close up. Ruisdael continued to include Bentheim Castle in his landscapes, seen in various settings and from different viewpoints, until his very last years	RUISDAEL, Jacob Isaackszon van	Bentheim Castle	Oil on canvas, 111 x 144 cm	1653	landscape	Dutch	1651-1700

33600-05group.jpg	"Catalogue number: Bredius 410.Probably Rembrandt's most famous and most controversial painting was given its erroneous title the Night Watch in the early 19th century. The title referred to the subdued lighting and led art critics to seek all manner of hidden mysteries in the painting. The original title, recorded in the still extant family chronicle of Captain Banning Cocq, together with a sketch of the painting, sounds rather dry by comparison: ""Sketch of the painting from the Great Hall of Cleveniers Doelen, in which the young Heer van Purmerlandt [Banning Cocq], as captain, orders his lieutenant, the Heer van Vlaerderdingen [Willem van Ruytenburch], to march the company out.""It is, therefore, a ""Doelen"" piece or group portrait in which the captain can be seen in the foreground wearing black and the lieutenant wearing yellow. What sets Rembrandt's group portrait apart from other comparable paintings is his use of chiaroscuro as a dramatic device. Interpretations seeking a plausible action fail to take into account that the scenery is made up more or less of individual ""types"". The painting includes the entire repertoire of portrait poses and gestures from Rembrandt's store of figures.There is inevitably a sense of celebration in the portrayal of individuals in a Dutch group painting. Yet whereas Frans Hals, for example, draws together his individual participants around a banquet scene, Rembrandt breaks up the group, so that individual characters and participants become absorbed in their own actions, each standing alone"	REMBRANDT Harmenszoon van Rijn	The Nightwatch	Oil on canvas, 363 x 437 cm	1642	portrait	Dutch	1601-1650
08122-susan.jpg	Cassatt preferred to paint friends and acquaintances. Her sister Lydia posed frequently.

41121-00antepe.jpg	"This majesty antependium comes from the Walpurgis church in Soest. It is the only surviving Romanesque antependium in Germany. What is noticeable about the voluminous treatment of the robes is the tapering folds of the red cloaks worn by Walpurgis, Mary, John, Augustine and Christ. They all end in an unusually sharp-edged jagged line. This provides a peculiar contrast to the forms otherwise employed in the garments and the bodies of the figures, which are undulating and gently rounded.This example illustrates the exceptional form of Romanesque painting known as the German ""zigzag style,"" or sometimes ""jagged style.""

11323-511delac.jpg	Delacroix's treatment of subjects from fashionable works frequently raised critical hackles, and he was assailed in the name of good taste, the Beautiful, and the Ideal. A notable victim of such disparagement was the scene drawn from Scott's Ivanhoe.

10539-land_oak.jpg	This painting is as much a tree portrait as a landscape study, as the sensitivity and naturalism of the painting imbues the subject with a great deal of character. John Crome, along with John Constable, was one of the earliest English artists to represent identifiable species of trees, rather than generalised forms. His works, renowned for their originality and vision, were inspired by direct observation of the natural world combined with a comprehensive study of Old Masters.

36850-st_peter.jpg	In his years in Italy, Gerard Seghers conformed to the ideas of the 'Tenebrosi'. After his return to Antwerp he could take full advantage of the fashionable interest in Caravaggist painting, which had become an international phenomenon. He became celebrated for his monumental half-length genre scenes. But he was highly regarded in the 1620s for his large religious and allegorical pictures, conceived in a genre style, and mostly done in landscape format. These paintings, such as the Denial of St Peter, contain scenes with numerous characters, depicted with lively poses and facial expressions, grouped compactly together against an undefined background; they are painted half-length or are cut off by the edge of the painting. The concealed candlelight casts a flickering and sharply contrasting gleam on the multi-coloured, theatrical clothing of the figures creating a powerful dramatic effect.These Caravaggist group compositions differ only in subject from contemporary secular genre paintings and just like them are ultimately derived from the compositions of Caravaggio's pupil Bartolomeo Manfredi. There is also a strong relationship with the style of Gerrit van Honthorst of Utrecht, who must have known Seghers in Rome	SEGHERS, Gerard	Denial of St Peter	Oil on canvas, 123 x 161 cm	1620s	religious	Flemish	1601-1650

The idyllic group comprises the Virgin and the Christ child, Joseph (at the left), the child John the Baptist, his mother Elizabeth (the Virgin's elder sister) and his father Zacharias (at the right). It was painted in the Marches, probably for a local patron, but for some reason it remained in Lotto's possession.

38258-healing.jpg	Gathered around Tobit are the key figures of the Old Testament account of his life: his wife, Anna, their son Tobias, the loyal dog that accompanied Tobias and the angel on their dangerous journey, and the fish that nearly killed Tobias before he caught it and removed its organs to make a medicine to restore his father's eyesight. For Strozzi the main means of expression is colour, so bright and rich compared to his other paintings that it seems an eloquent metaphor for the end to the old man's blindness.This painting, a biblical story depicted as a genre scene, is one of the several versions of this subject painted by Bernardo Strozzi	STROZZI, Bernardo	The Healing of Tobit	Oil on canvas, 158 x 224 cm	c. 1635	religious	Italian	1601-1650
09339-kitchen.jpg	Andrea Commodi was an Italian painter of the early-Baroque period. Born in Florence, but mostly active in Rome, he was a pupil of the painter Cigoli. He painted frescoes in the sacristy of San Carlo ai Catinari and a Fall of the Angels now in the Galleria Palatina (Palazzo Pitti) in Florence. One of his pupils was a juvenile Pietro da Cortona who moved to Rome and became one of the towering figures of the Italian Baroque. Another pupil was Giovanni Battista Stefaneschi (1582-1659)	COMMODI, Andrea	Young Woman in the Kitchen	Oil on canvas	-	genre	Italian	1601-1650

14184-08bolt.jpg	At first sight, this painting describing the feminine resistance preceding abandon, might seem to belong to the same vein of light-hearted, erotic themes that Fragonard was fond of throughout his career. However, the intensity of the chiaroscuro effects and the dramatic power of the diagonal composition, lend a certain gravity to the scene.Interestingly, this painting has a pendant illustrating sacred love, an Adoration of the Shepherds, also in the Louvre	FRAGONARD, Jean-Honoré	The Bolt	Oil on canvas, 73 x 93 cm	c. 1777	genre	French	1751-1800

35406-08assum.jpg	The Antwerp Cathedral was given a new marble high altar during the baroque refurbishment that reached a peak around the beginning of the 17th century. Rubens, by then the most famous artist of his day, was commissioned to paint an altarpiece.The image of the Assumption of the Virgin does not derive from the Bible but from an ecclesiastical tradition that took shape in the Middle Ages. By the 16th century, it had become a popular theme. The depiction of the Virgin, with her fluttering robe and swirling head-dress, is graceful and lively. She is borne up to heaven in a cloud by playful putti. Two angels at the top left of the painting are about to crown her with a garland of roses. The twelve apostles stand around her sarcophagus at the bottom. The three women who, according to legend, laid out the Virgin's body are also included. The attractive woman in the middle, wearing a red dress, is given greater prominence than the other bystanders. Her features are those of Rubens' wife, Isabella Brant, who died in June 1626, while the artist was working on this painting	RUBENS, Peter Paul	Assumption of the Virgin	Oil on panel, 490 x 325 cm	1626	religious	Flemish	1601-1650
